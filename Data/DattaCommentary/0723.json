  "name_transliterated": "Svatantrā",
  "meaning": "Being self-created She enjoys absolute freedom.",
  "commentary": "Sva+ tantra is ‘She who is self-created’. This entire creation belongs to Her and is under Her absolute control.\n\nOnly the Sadguru and the Divine Mother enjoy absolute freedom. Every other being is controlled by some other force- be it time, breath, health etc. Even the most powerful ruler depends on the earth and life-force for support and hence cannot claim to be absolutely free.\n\nAbsolute freedom means to have absolute control over the mind and the intellect even when enjoying freedom. Freedom is to be secured from ignorance and from illusion. Spiritual pursuits under the guidance of an able Sadguru are all directed to attain that goal. Only She can bless her devotee with absolute freedom."
