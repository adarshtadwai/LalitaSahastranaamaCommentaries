  "meaning": "She is exceptionally brave.",
  "commentary": "Dhīra is the synonym for Vīra.\n\nA really brave person is He who is able to accept the world as it is. Such a person will remain untouched by the world around him. The events in this world will not be able to change the stability of his mind. He understands that this creation is illusory (Maya). He will not aim to alter the creation (sristi); instead he alters his attitude and thinking to choose what he seeks to see (dristi). He picks what he wants to see. Just as a lotus blooms even amongst the dirty surroundings or a rose emerges even though it has thorns all around it, a yogi will emerge in the world. Living in the society, he will be able to maintain his mouna and his calmness. To change this creation is impossible; to overcome it is possible."
