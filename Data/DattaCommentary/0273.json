  "name_devanagari": "अनुग्रहदा",
  "name_transliterated": "Anugrahadā",
  "meaning": "As Sadāshivā, She accomplishes the task of granting Anugraha.",
  "commentary": "Anugraha is commonly understood to mean ‘bestowing blessings/ grace’. However anugraha consists of two words anu+graha. ‘Graha’ means forceful attraction. Anugraha means revolving around that forceful attraction.\n\nThe Supreme Lord follows those who forcefully attract Him and blesses them in accordance to what has been sought by them. Hasn’t the Lord declared in the Bhagavad Gita- ‘Ye yatha mām prapadyante tāms tathaiva bhajāmy aham’ which means ‘I will reward the person in accordance with the manner in which he attracts’.\n\nThe responsibility of putting in the requisite effort to attract Him lies within us. Where the attraction is feeble, the result will also be short lived. Where a person seeks permanent merger into Him, the same result will be granted."
