  "commentary": "She is the form of the Mahā-ahankaara. An individual possesses the individual ego that stems out of self-identity. This ahamkara is harmful as it causes separation from Divinity. The Supreme Lord also possesses an identity wherein He identifies with every being in this creation. To Him, every karma taking place in this universe is His own karma. Such an attitude is called the Mahā-ahamkaara and this is the source/root for all this creation.Due to this Mahā-ahamkara She takes on the name Garvitā."
