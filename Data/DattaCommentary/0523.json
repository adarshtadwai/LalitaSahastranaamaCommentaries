  "meaning": "She has 6 faces.",
  "commentary": "At this Ajna Chakra the Mother Goddess manifests as Lord Subrahmanya swami (Kumara Swamy or Skanda) and is Kaumari shakti. Lord Subrahmanya has 6 faces. A close relation exists between yoga, snake (naaga), birth of progeny, music (naada) and Subrahmanya Swamy. To be blessed with progeny His blessings are needed. Without His Ajna (order), none can proceed on this path of Yoga. The being will not be able to take even a single step in the yogic path without His permission. His 6 heads represent the 6 senses (indriyas) i.e. the 5 indriyas (senses) plus the mind. He is षडानना। (ṣaḍānanā.)"
