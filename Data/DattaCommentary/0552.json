  "meaning": "She destroys the fear of death.",
  "commentary": "In addition to the natural death (sahaja mrtyu), the other forms of death are akāla mrtyu (untimely death), kāla mrtyu (timely death), ghora mrtyu (terrible death) and roga mrtyu (death due to disease). The word ‘mrtyu’ refers not only to ‘death’ but also to the ‘fear of death’.\n\nMore than death it is the fear of death that is torturous. She dispels all such fears."
