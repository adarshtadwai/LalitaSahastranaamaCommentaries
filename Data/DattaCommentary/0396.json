  "meaning": "He is Brahma, He is Vishnu, He is Siva, He is Indra, He is Eternal, He is Supreme (Parama), He is the Lord of all. He is self-illumination (svarāt).",
  "commentary": "Parama can also be split as Para+ma where ‘ma’ stands for Lakshmi. Parama means this it is a force beyond the scope of the intellect, mind and intentions.\n\nDivinity can be worshipped as illumination (Prabharoopa) or as Parameshwari. The former is formless worship (nirguna upasana) and the latter is worship with form (saguna upasana). Worshipping illumination directly is not an easy approach. Take the case of a vehicle approaching with its headlights turned powerfully on. Blinded by the light it is impossible to even figure out the type of vehicle that is drawing near. As the light passes by, we will realize that it is a car that is familiar to us. The light moves still further, then we are able to recognize our relatives seated within. Likewise complete illumination blinds us. Hence the form that follows thereafter is worshipped in Saguna upasana. This procedure is apt for the karma yogis who follow the tradition of worship, puja, homas and so on. To the Jnana yogis who are replete with the Supreme Knowledge, She is Prabhavati (illumination). Each being has to move from the worship of form to the worship of the formless.\n\nIt is important to understand the bright illumination. This is what the Vedas teach –sa brahma sa sivah sendrah so’ksharah paramah svarāt–"
