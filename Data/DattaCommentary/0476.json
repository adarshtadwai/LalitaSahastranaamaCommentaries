  "name_transliterated": "āraktavarna",
  "meaning": "At the Vishuddha chakra, the Divine Mother is in the āraktavarna colour (a colour that is a mixture of blood red and ash).",
  "commentary": "Within the womb the foetus on its very first day of its formation is in this colour -Ekaratre kalalam bhavati. The being that was until then formless and invisible has now come into contact with food (anna) and thus a gross body is being taken on by it.\n\nThe Divine Mother seated at the Vishuddha Chakra sustains and nourishes the foetus during the first month of pregnancy. She is its sole support. She ensures its growth. She gives a form to that being which was until then formless. As she blesses it with a firm and strong body She is ‘Vajreshwari’ (refer namas 468 & 475)."
