  "commentary": "a) Kāmākshi is She who retains Lord Kāmeshwara as Her eye (akshi).\n\nb) She is the mother who fulfils all the desires (kaama) of her children.\n\n‘Kāma’ means ‘desires’. ‘Koti’ means ‘cream or lining’. For example, the term ‘koti (crore) rupees’ is implies ‘the pinnacle of materialistic prosperity’. Similarly, kāmakoti means the cream of all desires or the most-supreme desire. What could this be? To an ardent devotee, achieving liberation (Moksha) is the cream of all desires.\n\nAmong the four fold aims of life i.e. Dharma (rules of righteousness), artha (material prosperity), kāma (fulfilment of desires), Moksha (liberation), it is always Moksha that supersedes kaama (desires). Moksha is the cream of desires.\n\nShe resides as Goddess Kāmākshi in Kānchipuram. As Kāmakotikā She grants liberation (moksha) to her children."
