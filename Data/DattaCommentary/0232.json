  "commentary": "(This is one single name of 16 alphabets).\n\nYugas (eons) are 4. They are in the order of Krta Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. Kali Yuga is the last. We are in Kali Yuga.\n\nKali Yuga spans across 4,32,000 years. Dwapara Yuga had twice the number of years i.e. 8,64,000 years. Treta Yuga had thrice the number of years as in Kali Yuga i.e. 12,64,000 years. Krta Yuga had 4 times the number of years as in Kali Yuga i.e. 17,28,000 years.  Thus one set of 4 Yugas (eons) has 43,20,000 years.\n\n71 such sets of 4 Yugas form one Manvanthara (43,20,000*71). 14 such Manvantharas is one day of Lord Brahma i.e. (43,20,000*71*14) or 4,29,40,80,000 years This is the period of one Kalpa.\n\nBrahma has a life span of 100 years i.e. (4,29,40,80,000*100). This period is called the Maha Kalpa.\n\nThe greatest dissolution takes place at the end of this Maha Kalpa when this entire creation is wiped out. At such hour, Lord Maheshwara performs the dance of absolute bliss (महा ((mahā) tandava). She is the sole witness to this dance of bliss."
