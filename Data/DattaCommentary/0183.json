  "name_transliterated": "Niṣparigrahā",
  "meaning": "The Lord does not accept anything. He does not take even the merits (punya) or sins (pāpa) of any being nor does he give merit (punya) or sin (pāpa). It is only our actions that cause merit or demerit.",
  "commentary": "Parigraha means to accept in charity (dānam). She, who is eternally giving, never has a need to take anything.\n\nThe fifth chapter of Bhagavad Gita states –\n\nNādatte kasyachit पापं (pāpaṃ) na caiva sukrtam विभुहज्नानेनाव्रितं (vibhuhAjnānenāvritaṃ) ज्नानं (jnānaṃ) tena muhyanti jantavah\n\nAparigraha vrata is a very meritorious ritual in which the person undertaking the vrata does not accept anything from other beings. He will pluck the fruits from the forest and collect the grain that has fallen down in the fields, as they do not belong to any body and he sustains purely on this."
