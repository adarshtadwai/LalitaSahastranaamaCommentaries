  "commentary": "Ghoornita is a flicker of light in Her eyes. Through one of the scriptures called saamudrika shastra, one can state the qualities of a person just by observing the body movements. Observing the forehead, the eyes, the style of walking, talking and behaviour, his nature can be assessed. Based on this scripture, the ray of bliss that can be seen in Her eyes explains Her joy."
