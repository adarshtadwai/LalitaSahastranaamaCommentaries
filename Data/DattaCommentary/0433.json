  "commentary": "Pātala is a unique colour hard to describe. Likewise the beauty in the bliss that she grants is indescribable.\n\nThe above 3 names all refer to the different 3 levels of bliss -muda, pramoda and ananda.\n\nMuda is the bliss or happiness of this world and this life. It is the happiness that is got through worldly acquisitions. ‘Mada-śālinī’ means that She grants this worldly happiness on to Her devotee.\n\nPramoda is the bliss that belongs to the Gods (devata loka). ‘मद-घूर्णित-रक्ताक्षीऽ (‘Mada-ghūrṇita-raktākṣī’) implies that She showers this second level of bliss on Her devotee. She grants the pleasures of heaven.\n\n‘मद-पाटल-गन्द-भुःऽ (‘Mada-pāṭala-ganda-bhuḥ’) refers to the bliss enjoyed at the supreme (Parabrahma) level. It implies that She showers this ananda on to her children."
