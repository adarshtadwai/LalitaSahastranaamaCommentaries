  "meaning": "स्हे रेसिदेस् अस् चित्-कला इन् एवेर्य् बेइन्ग्। (She resides as Cit-kalā in every being.)",
  "commentary": "‘Kalā’ means ‘phase’. Just like the moon, each being has 16 phases (shodasha कला), (kalā),) which are the cause for its sustenance. Among them She is the चित्-कला। (Cit-kalā.)\n\nUpanishads declare that Parabrahma enters into the foetus from its Brahmarāndhra (the invisible opening at the top of the head) in the form of चित्-कला (Cit-kalā) (jnana). This चित्-कला (Cit-kalā) comes in the form of Pranashakti (life force). Life begins only after this. The चित्-कला (Cit-kalā) that had entered through the Brahmarāndhra should also leave the body through the same mode but this happens only in the case of liberated beings. In all other beings, it leaves the body through other exits."
