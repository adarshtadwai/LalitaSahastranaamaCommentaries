  "commentary": "Every living being born in this world, including fruits, mandatorily undergoes 6 types of modifications (vikaaras).They are –\n\nJāyate – Birth. This is the first modification. The being that was until then without the need of a body, now finds itself enveloped by a physical, visible and distinct body.\n\nAsti – Existence. Having been enveloped by this physical body, the being thinks that he is ‘existing’ in the physical body.\n\nVardhate –  Growth. ‘Nourishment’ of the body for growth.\n\nViparinamate – Physical changes that take place through the various stages of growth.\n\nApaksheeyate – Decaying and shrinking of the body with age.\n\nNashyati – Death; ceasing to live.\n\nThe Supreme Mother strives to take her devotees to that state which is devoid of these modifications."
