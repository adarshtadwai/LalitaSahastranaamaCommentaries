  "name_transliterated": "Kshetra swaroopa",
  "meaning": "O Arjuna, this physical body is called the kshetra, and one who resides within is called the Kshetrajna.Lalita Sahasranama too begins the Jnana khanda with this same reference. This shows the similarity not only in the content of the texts, but more importantly in the form that preached these texts.",
  "commentary": "Kshetra in common parlance refers to land owned; to a parliamentary constituency etc. Here however, Kshetra refers to this physical/ gross body.\n\nShe protects that being who is residing within this gross body. This physical body (shareera) is the ‘carrier’ for the being who resides within.\n\nThis physical body is addressed as kshetra for two reasons. ‘Kshata tranat’ means it protects the dweller within from injuries and hence is kshetra. ‘Kshayat’ means that it is destructible. Hence kshetra or the physical body is that form of Hers, which is subject to destruction and which protects the dweller within.\n\nThe Jnana khanda (kshetra kshetra vibhāga yoga) chapter of Bhagavad Gita opens with the proclamation –\n\nidam sariram kaunteya ksetram ity abhidhiyateetad yo vetti tam prahuh ksetra-jna iti tad-vidah"
