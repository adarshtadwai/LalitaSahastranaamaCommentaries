  "name_transliterated": "Puruṣārtha-pradā",
  "meaning": "She fulfils the 4 fold objectives of life (Purusharthas).",
  "commentary": "The 4 aims of life are- Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Moksha.\n\nThese four fold objectives have a logical sequence with Dharma & Artha forming one set; Kaama & Moksha comprising the other. Dharma stands for the rules of righteousness that have been laid down for each individual based on the stage of life he/she is in. Artha stands for the materialistic earnings. Dharma should be the basis through which Artha (money) is earned. The money that is earned (Artha) should be used purely for Dharmic activities. To put it differently, use Dharma to earn Artha and then use that Artha as per the rules prescribed as per Dharma.\n\nKāma stands for desires & Moksha for liberation. Desires are unending. It is very difficult for a normal person to give up desires. Hence, it is said that convert all the desires into those that lead us towards liberation.\n\nAs the name Purushartha contains the word Purusha, many mistakenly assume that these aims are applicable purely to men. This body is a city. The being that resides within this city is Purusha. Hence this name is equally applicable to both men and women."
