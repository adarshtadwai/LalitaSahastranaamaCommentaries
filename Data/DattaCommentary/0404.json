  "name_transliterated": "Bhakta-hārda-tamo-bheda-bhānumad-bhānu-santatiḥ",
  "meaning": "She is the Sun (Bhanu) within the heart of the devotee whose incessant rays (bhanumat) dispel and destroy the ignorance (tamas).",
  "commentary": "Tamas is utter darkness; a state of complete delusion and ignorance. Every time ignorance raises its head, one of Her rays strikes and destroys it. Even when the body is bed ridden, the heart continues to attract tamasic thoughts and traits.\n\nRegular worship and devotion are intertwined and as a result of this She seats herself in the heart of the devotee. Recitation of the name of God thus is the powerful weapon that protects. It is said that merely endless recitation of the divine names (nama japa) will grant liberation to the person in Kali Yuga.\n\nWith this the Prabha vidya is complete.\n\nThe next 24 names from 405 to 428 preach the Śivadūtī vidya.These 24 names take the person towards Shiva i.e. towards auspiciousness. The results of this worship will be similar to performing Gayatri upasana. Those who listen to this, those who visualize it and those who are able to understand/ experience the meaning of this Śivadūtī vidya will be rewarded by Divine Mother. The reward will be in the form of uniting the mind of the listener into that of Hers and by filling his mind purely with thoughts about the divine. The intellect of such persons will run towards divinity.\n\nThe next 24 names from 405 to 428 preach the Śivadūtī vidya."
