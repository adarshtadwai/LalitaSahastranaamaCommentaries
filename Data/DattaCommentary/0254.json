  "number": 254,
  "name_devanagari": "ध्यानध्यातृध्येयरूपा",
  "name_transliterated": "Dhyāna-dhyātṛ-dhyeya-rūpā",
  "meaning": "She manifests in the form of the triad (set of three) of meditation (dhyāna), the practitioner of meditation (dhyātr) and the object of meditation (dhyeya).",
  "commentary": "Every aspect in this world necessarily falls under the triad. The subject (the person who is desirous of procuring this knowledge), the object (the matter to be known) and the method of procuring this knowledge form the triad. They are classified as Icchhā, Jnana and Kriya aspects. Lord Dattatreya who has in Him all the 3 aspects is worshipped as a form of Trinity.\n\nWhat is meant by upāsana? Upasana means that the person conducting the upasana should be able to visualize the oneness (aikya) between himself, his Guru and the mantra given by his Guru. Contemplating and understanding that all these are one and the same is known as dhyana. Dhyana is thus the process of achieving this goal. Dhyatr is the person who is undertaking this practice. Dhyeya is the object of the meditation (what is sought to be known through dhyana).\n\nLet us understand the sequence of flow of the names in Lalita Sahasranama beginning with Mahā-yāga-kramārādhyā (name 230). This stage represents the aspirant who undertakes stringent practices, desirous of ultimate liberation. Due to this Sadhana he reaches the stage of Bhairava (become Shiva) and then worships Her (‘महा-भैरव-पोओजिताऽ ((‘Mahā-bhairava-poojitā’) – name 231). The aspirant further reaches the state of complete merger (aikya) with the Almighty and this is ‘महेश्वर-महाकल्प-महाताण्डव-सक्षिणी (‘Maheśvara-mahākalpa-mahātāṇḍava-sakṣiṇī) (name 232)’."
