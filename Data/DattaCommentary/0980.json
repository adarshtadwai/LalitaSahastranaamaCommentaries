  "commentary": "The statement ‘Jnana devahi kaivalyam’ means ‘Only through pure knowledge can the Supreme be known’.\n\nOnly pure knowledge can give permanent bliss. There is nothing in this creation that stands superior to such knowledge. For this reason one should pray to the Supreme to bless with Jnana. Jnana is Lakshmi and it is pure prosperity. To secure knowledge one should be truly humble and true student. Even trivial knowledge received from a small child or tiny facts found in torn paper pieces should be regarded, understood and read."
