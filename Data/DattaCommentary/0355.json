  "name_transliterated": "Saṃhṛtāśeṣa-pāṣaṇḍā",
  "meaning": "She destroys the non-believers (pāshandās). She merges their bad intellect (buddhi) into herself and clears the path for the sincere devotees.",
  "commentary": "Pāshandā are non-believers in existence of God who try to create a mental divide in the minds of true believers and try to destroy their beliefs. With their nonsensical arguments they cause a fall in the spiritual growth of a devotee.\n\nFor instance, you visit a friend, who sincerely worships a stone as Ganapati. He is able to see distinctly the features of Ganesha in that stone. With great enthusiasm he shows you the stone. You observe carefully but to your eyes, the features of Ganesha are not visible. God exists in everything and everywhere hence it is improper to discard his theory as rubbish. Perhaps you may not have matured enough to see God in that stone. At such times, be polite and congratulate him on his good luck and be silent thereafter. Pāshandās will ridicule and tease him for worshipping a stone. With this, that person’s faith in that stone will reduce and he will begin to doubt his earlier beliefs. He would have thus fallen one step."
