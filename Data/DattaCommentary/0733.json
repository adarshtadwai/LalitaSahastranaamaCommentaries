  "commentary": "Absorption/ merger of the mind is known as लया। (layā.) The end point of relentless nama japa (recitation of divine names) and music rendition (nāda) is the merger of the mind. Such dissolution showers true bliss.\n\nNandi symbolizes merger (लया)। ((layā).) Nandi plays the Mridamgam (percussion) instrument when his master Lord Shiva performs the dance of bliss (tāndava). Nandi is the master of this scripture on merger (Laya shāstra)."
