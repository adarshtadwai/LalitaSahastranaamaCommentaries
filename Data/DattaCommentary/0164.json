  "name_transliterated": "Nirmamā",
  "meaning": "Selfish feelings such as ‘my, mine’ are unknown to Her.",
  "commentary": "‘Mama’ means ‘mine’ as used in ‘my house, my work, my belongings’ and so on. The Supreme Mother, the mother of all, does not entertain such feelings. As a result, She is able to treat every being equally with love and compassion. In Her eyes, the Devatas and the demons are equal. Had she entertained feelings that only the Devatas belonged to Her, She would never have granted liberation to the demons killed by Her."
