  "commentary": "Sun, Moon and Fire are the three visible gods (pratyaksha daiva). It is imperative that they should be worshipped daily. Offering arghya to Sun God, tarpana to Moon God and offering worship to Fire God important rituals. Special prayers are offered to Moon on full and new moon days.\n\nFire inherently exits within every object- living and non-living, albeit in an invisible manner. It exists in water as badabāgni, our digestive system as jatarāgni etc. In her form as fire, She resides everywhere and in everything.Vahni symbolizes Tretagni (the 3 fires- Garhapatya, Ahavaniya and Dakshinagni) and of the triputi (triad). The location of Agni (fire) is the Ajna chakra located at the centre of the eyebrows. She is the fire of wisdom (jnānagni) and the fire of consciousness (chidāgni). She emerges from there to bestow wisdom and knowledge (Jnana) on to the deserving devotee."
