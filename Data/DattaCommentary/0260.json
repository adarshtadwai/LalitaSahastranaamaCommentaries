  "meaning": "She is present in the being during the deep sleep state of śuśupti (Suptā).",
  "commentary": "The mind tired after endless dreaming, drifts into a deep sleep state (Shushupti) wherein it loses its individual identity. It is actually the Divine Mother who is residing within the being at this stage of Suptā (deep sleep).\n\nThe seed letter for this state is ‘Ma’. This state is predominantly ruled by tamo guna and the being is now in the causal body (kārana shareera).\n\nFrom this it is clear that all the 3 states of existence are in fact experienced by the Supreme Mother who resides within each being. This is at the vyasthi (individual) level. These 3 states total the AUM (Omkara). This mantra (ॐ) ((Om)) thus covers all the 3 stages of existence. Taking initiation of this mantra from the Guru and chanting it has endless benefits."
