  "name_devanagari": "मोहिनी",
  "name_transliterated": "Mohinī",
  "meaning": "O Mother! By your grace Hari (Lord Vishnu) was once able to become the charming female Mohini and stir waves of passion in the mind of the most impassioned Lord Shiva itself. He who had burnt the three cities and who is the enemy of Kaama (the Lord of desire) could fall into the trap of moha. Manmatha (Kaama, the Lord of desire) is able to stir waves of passion in the minds of the greatest of saints.",
  "commentary": "Lord Vishnu emerged as Mohini Devi at the time of the churning of the ocean. In this form He created illusion in the demons, who although undeserving, were trying to get the nectar of immortality (amruta). Charmed by Mohini’s beauty the demons fell into her trap.\n\nJnani nam api chetansi Devi Bhagavati Hi SaBalat Akrishya mohay mahamaya Prychchati.\n\nThis is a lesson that all those who cannot control their desires and allow their mind to wander wastefully get trapped under her web of illusion.\n\nThe 5th stanza of Soundarya Lahari states –\n\nHaris tvam aradhya pranata-jana-saubhagya-jananimPura nari bhutva Pura-ripum api ksobham anayat;Smaro’pi tvam natva rati-nayana-lehyena vapushaMuninam apyantah prabhavati hi mohaya mahatam."
