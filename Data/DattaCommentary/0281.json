  "name_transliterated": "Unmeṣa-nimiṣotpanna-vipanna-bhuvānāvalī",
  "meaning": "The creation, sustenance and dissolution of this entire creation takes place just within the blinking of Her eyelids.",
  "commentary": "Unmesha and nimesha are the 2 actions of opening and closing of the eyes respectively. Within the fraction of the second that the Supreme Mother takes for this action of blinking, the creation (utpanna) and dissolution (vipanna) of the universe (bhuvana) gets complete.\n\n‘Nimisha’ also means ‘minute’. Emperor Nimi sought a boon that kala (time) should be named after him (nimit or nimisha). Nimit got altered to minute. In common usage, nimisha is a time of 60 seconds. However, the true meaning of nimisha is a ‘fraction of a second’- the smallest unit of time.\n\nWhat is fraction of a second to Her, is the total of all these eons to us! This is the time difference between Gods and humans."
