  "meaning": "She is beyond all states of existence.",
  "commentary": "The person who is completely into the turya state is beyond all states of existence. It is the Divine Mother who exists at that stage. She who takes her devotee to such state.\n\nThe following few names from 264 to 274 describe Her 5 main functions also known as the pancha-krtyas. She showers Her energy and ensures that the five Brahmas (Pancha-brahmas) accomplish these tasks. It can be understood that a) She manifests in the form of the five Brahmas b) She brings together the 5 basic elements (pancha bhootas) that were so far absorbed within Her. The combination of these 5 elements results in creation. This is known as पन्छीकरण। (Panchīkaraṇa.)"
