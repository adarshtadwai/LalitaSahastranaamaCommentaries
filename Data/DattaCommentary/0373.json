  "name_transliterated": "Kāmeśvara-prāna-nāḍī",
  "meaning": "She is the central life force (prāna nādi) for Lord Kāmeśwara.",
  "commentary": "Kāmeśwara is Parabrahma. She is the life force (chaitanya) for Parabrahma. She causes movement in Him, who is otherwise seated motionless.\n\nSushumna nādi is the main central energy channel in yoga through which the Kundalini energy flows and hence is the prāna nādi. It is located in the centre of the spine. The routine inhalation and exhalation (breathing) throughout life is called gamāgama. Ida and Pingala nādis perform this function. The breath needs to be willfully restrained (kumbhaka) and pushed on to the path of the Sushumna nādi. It then begins to ascend the steps within the Sushumna.\n\nPranayama should be performed until the body is tired or it perspires. Such method cleanses all types of sins. It renders the mind pure and prevents further committing of sins.\n\nEven within the individual (jeevatma), it is the Divine Mother who causes the movement of the Sushumna. She is the main praana naadi."
