  "name_transliterated": "Mahā-bhogā",
  "meaning": "She enjoys the greatest and most supreme luxuries.",
  "commentary": "The entire universe is Her wealth. She enjoys the luxuries provided by it and bestows such luxuries on Her children.\n\n‘Bhogā’ in common parlance refers to the materialistic luxuries, comforts, wealth and power (sukha) that give temporal joy. There is no cap for such desires and they create discontent.\n\nTake the case of a homeless beggar living under a shade of a tree. Suffering the intensity of heat and cold, all he desires is a small shelter. He finds the shelter in a tarpaulin sheet that gives him the protection needed. But yet at heart he seeks more comfort. Assume that good tidings come his way and he moves into a tiny hut. Now the small tiled house that he can see from his window of his hut beckons him. He is sure that he would find more comfort and happiness there. Sometime later he is able to move into the tiled roof house, but no, there is no comfort. From his window he can see a large mansion with all its comforts. He desires to move into it. Such temporal happiness always causes an opening for another desire. It does not give contentment. Even food gives temporal contentment.\n\nYet such temporal happiness needs to end at some point. The end point is the merger into supreme bliss. This supreme bliss is the ultimate luxury (Maha भोगा) (bhogā)) that the Divine Mother grants upon Her children.\n\nShe shares with her children Her treasure which is, the supreme bliss, a bliss that which has no comparison and that which has none superior to it. Such Maha भोगा (bhogā) is also called by various names Niratishayānanda, Parama sukha, Atma sukha and so on. This is state of total contentment and bliss."
