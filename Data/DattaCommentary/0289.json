  "name_transliterated": "Śruti-sīmanta-sindūrī-kṛta-pādābja-dhūlikā",
  "meaning": "When the Vedas (shruti) bow at Her feet, the dust of Her feet (pādabja dhūlika) forms the sindhūra on the forehead of the Vedas.",
  "commentary": "This name is very deep in meaning and represents the Vedas (the ultimate sacred texts) as Goddesses who bow at Her lotus feet. Sindhūra is a red colour powder that adorns the seemanta (the partition made in the hair above the forehead) of married ladies and it bestows auspiciousness.\n\nThe Vedas worshipping Her feet shows Her supremacy over them.\n\nFor various different reasons, men and women offer complete obeisance (sāshtānga namaskāra) to the deity in different ways. Men have to touch their entire body to the ground when bowing down before the deity. With this, the dust from the feet of the Lord touches their forehead (lalāta). The destiny (Brahma lipi) for men lies on their forehead and to change this towards the good, such obeisance should be offered by men.\n\nThe ladies carry their auspiciousness in their head (siras, the area above the forehead). When ladies offer obeisance, it is their seemanta (the partition in the hair above the forehead) that touches the ground and brings to them auspiciousness. In addition, both these respective styles also have health reasons to support them."
