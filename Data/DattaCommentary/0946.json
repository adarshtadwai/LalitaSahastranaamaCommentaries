  "name_devanagari": "पञ्चयज्ञप्रिया",
  "name_transliterated": "Pañca-yajña-priyā",
  "meaning": "She loves the offerings through the five sacrifices/ rituals (yagnas) –Deva- yagna, Pitr-yagna, Brahma-yagna, Bhuta-yagna, Manushya-yagna.",
  "commentary": "It is not possible to ever come across a person who is devoid of sin. When talking, drinking, blinking, eating, breathing, cleaning, sweeping, grinding or when engaged in any other activity, some germs/bacteria invariably get killed. They may be insignificant insects; nevertheless they too are living beings. These 5 yagnas mentioned above are conducted to expiate oneself from even these seemingly trivial sins. Our daily pujas, recitation of mantras, annual offerings to forefathers, offering hospitality to guests and all our other traditions are part of these yagnas. When performed knowingly or unknowingly, they relieve us of all such sins."
