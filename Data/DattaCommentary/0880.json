  "meaning": "You appear like sunlight to those who are drowned in ignorance (ajnana) that is like a fearful darkness (timira). You make the minds of the dull witted (जदा) ((jadā)) grow fertile and turn it eligible to receive the knowledge of the self. You are the Cintāmani gem (wish fulfilling gem) to those who are sunk in poverty (daridra). You are Vāhari Devi (boar faced) and using your tusks you pull up those who are deeply sunk (nimagna) in this samsāra.",
  "commentary": "(This is one single name and hence there should be no gap/ pause in-between).\n\nSamsāra is the endless cycle of births and deaths emerging out of the bondages. It includes all our attachments. It is impossible for one who is entangled in this samsara to exit out of it with his individual efforts. The Divine Mother possesses the expertise to rescue and uplift the beings who are sunk. Our efforts and our prayers draw Her attention towards us.\n\nThe 3rd verse of Soundarya Lahiri praises the Divine Mother as-\n\nAvidyānam-antas-timira-mihira-dvipanagariJadānam chaitanya stabaka makaranda srutijhariDaridrānam chintamaniguannika janmajaladhauNimagnānam damstra muraripu-varāhasya bhavati."
