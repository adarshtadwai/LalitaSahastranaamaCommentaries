  "meaning": "When the five elements (pancha bhutas) are in harmony, the five attributes of the elements will manifest in the yogi in the right proportions, and the fire of yoga will be kindled and the body will be full of that fire.",
  "commentary": "A yogi can transcend to levels wherein he goes above the limitations of time.\n\nThe following verse appears in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad –\n\nprthivyaptejo’nilakhe samutthite panchatmake yogagune pravrttena tasya rogo na jara na mrtyuh praptasya yogagnimayam sariram\n\nIn other words, the five elements will be invoked to activate the right qualities so that the physical body is free of disease, aging and death. The body of a yogi emanates the brilliance of the fire of yoga.\n\nAt such a state, the yogi will be in Samadhi for days at stretch. He would have transcended the limitations of time. The story of Chaitanya Prabhu at Puri Jagannath temple in Odisha stands as a proof of this. Such a state is achieved purely through Her grace."
