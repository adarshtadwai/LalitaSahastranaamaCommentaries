  "commentary": "At one point of time the Supreme Mother destroyed demons Shumbha and Nishumbha. Many eons after this (after many manvantara) these 2 demons were reborn in the clan (tribe) of Nanda. (Nanda and Yashoda are the foster parents of Lord Krishna). The Supreme Mother took birth as Krishna’s sister and destroyed these demons. Thereafter she settled down in the Vindhya Mountain range.\n\nAmong the huge mountain ranges that protect and support us are the Vindhyas. Within this range are the sacred Jyotirlinga temples such as Omkaareshwara (Madhya Pradesh) and Mahakaleshwar. The sacred River Narmada flows within this range."
