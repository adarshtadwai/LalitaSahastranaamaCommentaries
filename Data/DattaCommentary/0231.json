  "commentary": "Mahā – bhairava worships Her.\n\nBhairava is an incarnation of Lord Shiva and He is the kshetra pālaka (protector of the sacred place; guardian deity) at various temples. The trip to such sacred places is incomplete unless this kshetra pālaka temple is visited. He guards the sacred town of Kashi in his form as Kāla bhairava.\n\nBhairavas are many – Kāla-bhairava, Kalpānta-bhairava, Ruru-bhairava, Ugra-bhairava, Chanda-bhairava, Prachanda-bhairava and so on. As all these Bhairavas worship Her, She is महा-भैरव-पोओजिता। (Mahā-bhairava-poojitā.)\n\nVery similar to this, within the being there is a kshetra pālaka (guardian deity) who protects the being. This is the intellect (buddhi). It is this intellect that is being referred to here subtly. The subtle advice is to use this intellect (Mahā bhairava) to eternally worship Her."
