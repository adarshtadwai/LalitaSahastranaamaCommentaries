  "commentary": "As it is the Divine Mother who has manifested as Krishna (Incarnation of Vishnu), a lot of similarities can be found between the two. Krishna was feminine- looking and is depicted in a tribhangi pose. Krishna is accompanied by Rukmini and Satyabhama, who represent Goddesses of prosperity and knowledge respectively. The Divine Mother is served by Goddesses Rama and Vani, who are the Goddesses of prosperity and knowledge. Many more comparisons can be drawn."
