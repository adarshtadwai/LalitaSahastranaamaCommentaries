  "name_transliterated": "Ati-garvitā",
  "meaning": "She takes great pride (garva) in her splendour (soundarya).",
  "commentary": "This pride is purely aimed at depriving Her devotees of their ego. It stems out of Her confidence that She can bring out the desired changes in them.\n\nIt is humanly impossible to bring about a complete transformation in another human being. Only the Sadguru or Goddess Bhagawati can achieve this feat."
