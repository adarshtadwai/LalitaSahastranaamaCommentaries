  "commentary": "The Sun, Moon and the Fire (Agni) are Her three eyes among which Agni is Her third eye that is located at the forehead.\n\nShiva is addressed as ‘Trayambaka’ (three eyed). Ambaka refers to eyes. The names Trinayana and Trilochana also signify the same essence.\n\nEvery person has a third eye that exists subtly at the point of Ajna chakra (centre of the forehead). Lambika sutra known as Lambika mudra exists there. This third eye should not be exposed to sunlight, wind, fire etc. and should be protected at all times. This rule is more valid for women. It is also one of the primary gates for the life energy movement (praana shakti). Applying kumkum, sandal paste or vibhuti at this point acts as a lock for the gate and prevents the life energy from ebbing away.\n\nb) She possesses the complete knowledge of the three times- past, present and future (Trikaala jnana). Hence She is Trinayana.\n\nc) She is the form of the seed letters (aksharas) ‘Swaha, Vaushat and Vashat’ used during homa."
