  "commentary": "1) Together with Her subsidiary Anga devatas, She resides within the being and protects him.\n\nThe Gods who are responsible for each and every body part (anga) are known as the Anga Devatas. Through the process of ‘anganyāsa and karanayāsa’ or the ‘Keshava namas’, the Devatas (deities) are invoked into the body parts. Deities (Devatas) come and reside in the body parts (anga) of those who perform holy deeds.\n\n2) Vedas have six limbs (shad+anga). Learning of Vedas is complete only when the learning of its limbs (veda angas) is also mastered. She is a combined form of Vedas, Vedangas and Shastras. She is Saraswati."
