  "name_transliterated": "Nirābādhā",
  "meaning": "She is indestructible. Here it refers to the supreme knowledge (Jnana) that is indestructible.",
  "commentary": "Abādha refers to destruction. Ignorance ropes us in a delusion that leads to destruction. Take the case of a person walking on a beach who suddenly notices a shining silver stone far away. Deceived by its glitter, he rushes towards it in desire and hope, only to realize that it was a piece of shell that had been glittering due to sunlight. This is the case of delusion caused by ignorance. Such knowledge is also destructible.\n\nBeing over and above such ignorance and delusion, She has in Her the Supreme Knowledge that knows no destruction. Further, She causes such indestructible knowledge to sprout in us which washes away the delusions and fallacies."
