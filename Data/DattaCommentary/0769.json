  "commentary": "Yagnas are very dear to Paramatma. At the beginning of creation Paramatma created yagnas and human beings simultaneously. He sought that the beings should seek him again through the process of yagna. He blessed that all beings would achieve their comforts through the medium of yagna. Homa are a part of yagna.\n\nBhagavad Gita states that Yagnas are of various types-\n\ndravya-yajnas tapo-yajna  yoga-yajnas tathaparesvadhyaya-jnana-yajnas ca  yatayah samsita-vratah\n\nEach and every task that a person undertakes sincerely is to him ‘yagna’. Collecting the materials for the homa is a yagna to the person who undertakes it sincerely. Conducting penance (tapas) is also a yagna. Performing Yoga, studying and acquiring knowledge (Jnana) can be classified as yagna when undertaking with the right attitude."
