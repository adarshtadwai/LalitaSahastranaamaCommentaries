  "number": 900,
  "name_devanagari": "नैष्कर्म्या",
  "name_transliterated": "Naiṣkarmyā",
  "meaning": "She rewards her disciple with the ability to perform nishkaama karma (performance of selfless/ desireless action).",
  "commentary": "Naishkarmya siddhi is the greatest achievement as per Advaita Vedanta. There is no siddhi that can equal it.\n\nThe greatest teaching passed on by Krishna to Arjuna through the Bhagavad Gita was the performance of selfless service. He preached that one should complete his/her duty without any expectation of reward. Duty (action, karma) should never be given up however necessarily its fruits should be given up.\n\nWith this name 9 avaranas/ enclosures are completed. We now step into the last 100 names. This is a recapitulation of all that has been taught earlier and the results achieved."
