  "commentary": "1) ‘Hree’ means ‘modest’. She is very modest and modesty is very dear to Her.\n\nChandi saptashati praises the trait of modesty (lajja) of Divine Mother in the following verse –\n\nया देवी सर्व-भुतेशु लज्जा-रुउपेन सम्स्थिता ।नमस्-तस्यै नमस्-तस्यै नमस्-तस्यै नमो नमह् (Yā devī sarva-bhuteśu lajjā-ruupena samsthitā |Namas-tasyai namas-tasyai namas-tasyai namo namah)\n\nThis trait of modesty is equally applicable to both men and women.\n\n2) Hreem is Her intellect (mati, buddhi).\n\n3) She is over and above even the seed letter ‘Hreem’. Hreemati can also be split as ‘hreem + ati’. Ati means over and above. It drives home the fact that at the most supreme level, Paramatma is beyond all the seed letters (beejaksharas) including the greatest ones such as ॐ (Om) and Hreem."
