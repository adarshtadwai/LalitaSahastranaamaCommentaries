  "name_transliterated": "Madhu-prītā",
  "meaning": "The Divine Mother loves honey.",
  "commentary": "Honey should be naturally procured without causing any harm or injury to the bees. Bees should not even be smoked out of the hive. After the bees naturally discard the hive, it should be broken down and honey extracted from it. Abhisheka or an offering of honey thus procured is very dear to Divine Mother.\n\nConsumption of honey renders the bone marrow (meda) strong and healthy. Every person, irrespective of age should consume a teaspoon of honey daily."
