  "number": 184,
  "name_devanagari": "निस्तुला",
  "name_transliterated": "Nistulā",
  "meaning": "O Divine Mother! O daughter of the snow capped Himalayas! Your beauty is beyond comparison. Brahma and others try to describe and weigh your beauty but they are not able to find any comparison against which they can measure it.",
  "commentary": "Soundarya Lahiri extols Her as –\n\nत्वदीयम् सोउन्दर्यं तुहिनगिरि-कन्य्ē तुलयितुंकवीन्द्र्ã: कल्पन्ते कथमपि विरिन्छि-प्रभ्रुतयह् (Tvadīyam soundaryaṃ tuhinagiri-kanyē tulayituṃkavīndrã: kalpante kathamapi virinchi-prabhrutayah)\n\nThe word ‘tulayitum’ means ‘beyond measure’. Not merely Her physical beauty, Her bliss (ananda, Soundarya) is also immeasurable.\n\nUp to now, Her Supreme Essence has been extolled in many wonderful ways. This set of names end with a final declaration that She is unequalled in every aspect (Nistula). The depth of teaching and knowledge shared in the last few names are unequalled and beyond measure. Trying to ascertain a value or a measure to these names is impossible.\n\nIn the next few names, the method of worshipping Her as Durga is being taught. From lessons on Vedanta, Lalita Sahasranama now moves back into the methods of worship (Upasana marga) and Her gross form (vigraha roopa)."
