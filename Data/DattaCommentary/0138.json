  "name_devanagari": "निराकुला",
  "name_transliterated": "Nirākulā",
  "meaning": "She is without tensions. She is unruffled.",
  "commentary": "Ākula means tensions, afflictions, sorrows, confusions and the like. She is eternally in a calm state. She brings the devotee to such a state by removing his 7 types of vices/ afflictions (vyasana).\n\nA Sadguru too, even without the knowledge of the devotee, gradually brings out a transformation in him/her and relieves him of his vices. Bad traits not only of this birth, but those of many past births are gradually weeded out by Him. He causes a change in heart and causes good thoughts to seep in. For example, a devotee who is a chain smoker, out of love and respect for his Sadguru, will refrain for hours without smoking in His presence. Gradually thus, step by step he is relieved of his vice."
