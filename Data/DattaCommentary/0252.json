  "meaning": "She enjoys eternal ultimate bliss.",
  "commentary": "A truly knowledgeable person (Chinmayī) has no expectations and no desires and thus enjoys eternal bliss.\n\nA person who expects (it could be anything such as money, help, appreciation, recognition and so on) can never be happy. This is because whenever the situation is not in accordance to the perceived expectation, it causes unhappiness or distress. At times, even when the positive outcome far exceeds the desired expectation, the net result could still be disastrous. For instance, a person who buys a lottery ticket with an expectation of earning some prize will be distressed when he fails to get any prize. Another person who bought the ticket with a similar intent will collapse due to excitement when informed that he has bagged the bumper prize of 5 crore rupees.\n\nContrary to this, is the attitude wherein a person goes on performing his/her allotted or prescribed duty irrespective of praise or abuse. There is no expectation of any reward, recognition or merit. A person with such an attitude remains eternally blissful. External events and the net results cannot destabilize him/her from this exalted blissful state."
