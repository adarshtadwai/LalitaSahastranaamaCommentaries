  "meaning": "Everything happens on account of Her potency. It is the energy without whose will even a tiny blade of grass will not move.",
  "commentary": "Dhatus are the basic tissues that support and nourish the gross body. Parashakti is revered as the 10th dhatu, which is the most important support for every other dhatu.\n\nRasa (chyle), rakta (blood), mamsa (muscle), majja (bone marrow), asthi (bone), meda (brain and spinal cord), shukla (sperm and ovum) are the seven main tissues that are essential for the existence of the gross body. Ojas (vigor) is the support for these seven basic dhatus and therefore is addressed as the eighth dhatu. Prana (life force) is referred to as the ninth dhatu since the above dhatus cannot function without the life force. Parashakti is said to be the tenth dhatu as it supports the life force itself!\n\nUpanishads describe the Parashakti as- Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate svabhaviki jnana."
