  "meaning": "She is beyond (over and above) this universe (prapancha).",
  "commentary": "‘Prapancha’ consists of two words- pra+pancha, which means ‘that which has undergone the process of pancheekarana’\n\n(the process in which the subtle matter transforms into gross matter through the medium of the five basic elements (pancha bhootas)).\n\nEvery object and every being in this creation necessarily has its origin in the five basic elements (pancha bhootas i.e. earth, water, fire, air and space). These 5 basic elements in turn originate out of the 5 tanmaatras as explained in the verse –\n\nमहतो अहम्कार, अहम्कारत् पन्छतन्मत्राणि पन्छतन्मात्रेभ्यह् पन्छमहभोओतानि। (Mahato ahamkāra, ahamkārat panchatanmatrāṇi panchatanmātrebhyah panchamahabhootāni.)\n\nTanmātras have a subtle existence. Just as there exists a physical earth, there also exists a subtle earth that is comparable to an atom and which in reality, is the source for this earth. The energy that is supplied by that subtle element ensures that the contents of this earth do not get depleted.\n\nGoing a little deeper into the subject, we should understand that this body is a universe (prapancha) in itself.\n\nOnly because of the existence of this body (universe), we are able to perceive the outer universe (prapancha). When it is said that the Kundalini energy that reaches the Sahasrara drenches the entire universe, it refers to the body.\n\nThe Divine Mother, who does not have a body (śareera, carrier) is without this universe (prapancha) and hence is निष्प्रपञ्चा। (Niṣprapañcā.) The description about Her residence etc., given in earlier names, was only to help us focus and concentrate on Her."
