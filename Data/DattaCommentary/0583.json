  "name_devanagari": "आत्मविद्या",
  "name_transliterated": "Ātma-vidyā",
  "meaning": "आत्म-विद्या (Ātma-vidyā) is the knowledge that teaches a person about the true self. Such knowledge is also Her form.",
  "commentary": "The initiation that Nachiketa received from Lord Yama, Prahlada from Lord Dattatreya, Maitreyi from Maharishi Yangyavalkya, Savitri from Lord Yama is nothing but आत्म-विद्या। (Ātma-vidyā.) Maharishi Pippaladi had initiated 6 rishis (great saints) into this Knowledge through his Prashnopanishad.\n\nAll the mantras and conversations in these texts summarize आत्म-विद्या। (Ātma-vidyā.) Further Lord Dattatreya has passed on this knowledge through the Datta Samhita and Avadhoota Gita and various Datta Sutras. Initially Datta taught this knowledge to his Mother Anasuya. Attachment towards her son prevented Anasuya from permitting him to travel around the lokas and reaching out to people in distress. At such a crucial time Datta initiated her into this divine knowledge (आत्म-विद्या) ((Ātma-vidyā)) due to which she was relieved from the bondages of life."
