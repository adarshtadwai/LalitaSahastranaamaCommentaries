  "meaning": "For the purposes of accomplishing the task of dissolution (samhāra), She manifests as Rudra.",
  "commentary": "Deities in general do not possess eyelids and have no tears. Shiva is the first deity to have tears in His eyes.His tears were a result of the emotion that overcame Him upon seeing the distress of His demon devotees. For having got tears in His eyes, He was titled Rudra.\n\nAs the eyes of the deities are tremendously energized and powerful, one should not stand directly in front of the deity but should always look at them from an angle. Only the flagpole is placed directly in front of the deity. The vehicle of the deity is also placed directly in front, but the vehicle, be it a peacock or a bull or a mouse, is intelligent enough to cast a sidewards glance on the Lord.\n\n270. TirodhānakarīMeaning – She is the force who ensures that the task of tirodhāna (fourth of the five tasks) is accomplished."
