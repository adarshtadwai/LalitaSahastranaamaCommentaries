  "name_devanagari": "कामपूजिता",
  "name_transliterated": "Kāma-pūjitā",
  "meaning": "Kāma, the Lord of desires, reverentially worships Her. She lovingly accepts this worship.",
  "commentary": "Lord Kāma has no body (Videha). Arunopanishad is a great scripture that details about the Supreme Mother, Her upasana, about the Srichakra and many more. This great text describes about Kāma Deva and his upasana. It states that though this Lord has no body, he undertook penance. He has no tongue yet he tasted the sweetness that arises from sadhana. He has no neck yet he wears a garland around it.\n\nHere Videha refers that person who is able to give up the attachment and pride (abhimāna) over his body. King Janaka was praised as Vaideha not because He was born in the kingdom of Videha, but because he had completely given up attachment towards his body. He was not consciousness of his physical body or of its needs. He had self-surrendered (atmārpana). Videha means he now exists in the form of kaama (desires). One who takes on the form of water will not fear water. Fire cannot fear fire. Likewise, a person who takes on the form of kāma (desires), cannot fear kāma (desires). The Supreme Mother loves worship offered by such persons.\n\nA spiritual aspirant who undertakes intense Pranayama (Kāmeshwara prāna nādi), is cleansed of all his karmas and sins (i.e. reaches a stage of Krtagnya) and the worship of such persons is loved by the Divine Mother (Kāma poojita).  Thus these 3 names teach the process to be adopted by the spiritual aspirants and the stages to which it shall lead."
