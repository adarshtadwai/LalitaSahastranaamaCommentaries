  "meaning": "She is the 3 energies – Iccha shakti, Jnana shakti and Kriya shakti.",
  "commentary": "Iccha, Jnana and kriya shaktis form a triad of 3 energies (triputi).\n\nIccha shakti is the power of intention. For instance a person gets a thought or makes a resolve of accomplishing a particular task. This intent is Iccha shakti. He now  understands that to achieve this task certain equipment, money or particular knowledge is needed. Such knowledge is the Jnana shakti. He then sets about arranging the materials required and accomplishes the task. This is Kriya shakti (action).\n\nA desire to seek God is Iccha shakti. Understanding the process of this journey is Jnana shakti. Putting in the right efforts to reach the goal is Kriya shakti.\n\nThe Iccha shakti- Jnana Shakti- Kriya shakti displayed by a being is in reality the energy of the Divine Mother who is residing within the body. The 3 shaktis are Her power of expression. They are the basis for every action in this world. Without them, there can be no creation."
