  "meaning": "She exists in the form of the four Vedas.",
  "commentary": "Vedas are divine. They are the storehouse of the greatest knowledge. ‘Veda’ means ‘supreme knowledge’ (Jnana). Addressing the Divine Mother as Vedas re-iterates the fact that She is the Supreme Knowledge.\n\n‘Shruti’ means ‘hearing or listening’. The ancient sages listened to the divine truths as they were passed down the generations and learnt them. For this reason, Vedas are addressed as Shruti.\n\nPowerful memory and good retentive power (medha) is the primary requirement for imbibing the essence of the Vedas."
