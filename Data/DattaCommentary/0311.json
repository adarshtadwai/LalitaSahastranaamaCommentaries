  "name_transliterated": "Rasyā",
  "meaning": "She is abounding in supreme essence, the taste of which is the source of unending joy.",
  "commentary": "Rasya means ‘extreme delight, taste, essence’. For example, understanding in depth the essence contained in the name ‘Rama’ bestows supreme joy and bliss. There is no wonder then, that Saint Tyagaraja, who was downed in this supreme unending joy, composed the bhajan ‘Rama nama yenta ruchira..’ which means –  What sweetness/ taste exists in the name ‘Rama’!\n\nVedas and Vedanta are subjects that teach us about the true essence of the self (atma tattva). Through the deep understanding of this subject the person drowns in supreme joy; this supreme taste is unexplainable. It is like a cap for all the joys enjoyed in this universe. This is Rasya. This is the final state.\n\nTaitareeya Upanishad explains this state in the verse- Raso vai sah Rasam hyeva’yam labdhva’nandi bhavati.Meaning – The individual being (jiva) who has tasted the flavour (rasa) of the bliss of the Supreme, is also blissful.\n\nTo the one who is lost in this bliss, nothing else appears tasty in this world.\n\nThe name ‘Russia’ originates out of ‘Rasya’. Russia is a beautiful land fully covered in snow and is like a beautiful cap for this universe. Many great sages reside in this beautiful land. Kaikeyi (mother of Bharata or step mother of Rama) belonged to Rasya.\n\nThe seed-letters ‘Hreem’ and ‘Shreem’ are very dear to the Divine Mother. The names beginning from ‘Hrīṁkārī’ (nama 301) up to ‘Rasya’ explain the same essence of ‘Hreem’ and contain in-depth meanings hidden in the word Hreem. The worship of ‘Hreem’ (Hreem upasana) has been conducted here in the form of sound (nada roopa). This leads the aspirant towards Goddess Narayani. Upasakas meditate on Hreem when they recite these names."
