  "meaning": "She takes great pleasure in the plays/acts (lilās) of her devotees.",
  "commentary": "The sadhana/upasana undertaken by yogis is known as Lila. This name can also be interpreted to means that this entire creation and dissolution are playful acts to Her.\n\nबाल-लील-विनोदिनी (Bāla-līla-vinodinī) is at times considered as a single name. At such time, it should be understood that She enjoys the playful acts (leelas) of little Bala Devi. During the war with Bhandasura, the 9-year-old Bālā Devi fought with these sons of Bhanda and playfully killed them. Divine Mother took great pride in watching her actions."
