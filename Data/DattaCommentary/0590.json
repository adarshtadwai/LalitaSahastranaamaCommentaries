  "meaning": "Her power is such that just upon the blinking of Her eyelids, crores of Lakshmi Devis’ (limitless prosperity) attend and serve Her.",
  "commentary": "(This entire line is one name and there should be no break/ pause in-between).\n\nA devotee who has secured Her grace will find that crores of Lakshmis’ attend and serve him. However a true devotee will reject this and seek that they serve the Supreme Mother itself. A true devotee will reject the accomplishments (siddhis) that come en-route on his path to liberation."
