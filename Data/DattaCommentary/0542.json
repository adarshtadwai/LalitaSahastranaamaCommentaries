  "commentary": "a) To Her, the devotees’ the punya (merit, virtue) is itself Her glory/fame.\n\nSuch acquisitions of Her devotee give her enormous happiness.\n\nb) पुण्यकीर्तिः (Puṇyakīrtiḥ) also implies that the devotee who increases the balance of merit (punya) to his credit can achieve great renown (keerti, fame). Such sadkeerti (good, auspicious fame) leads him towards divinity.\n\nA person can become famous by efficiently mimicking a donkey, but of what use is such fame? It leads the person nowhere. There is a Vedic aphorism – ‘Keertirasya poorvaagacchati janataa maa yataha’   which means that sadkeerti is a primary pre-requisite for being blessed with a good body and good health. Fame achieved due to meritorious, benevolent and good tasks is sadkeerti. In other words, merit earned from good deeds results in good fame (keerti) and this in turn forms the basis for acquiring a good body, good family and good health in the subsequent birth."
