  "commentary": "1)  She brings about a transformation in the mind of the devotee and helps him/her overcome mada (self-pride/ arrogance).\n\nPride is of varied types – Dhana mada- infatuation/ pride due to riches; Vidya mada- pride due to knowledge (vidya mada), intoxication due to power, and many more. She destroys all forms of mada in the devotee.\n\n2)  Madanāśinī can be split as madana+ ashini. ‘Madana’ refers to the desires, intentions (sankalpas) of the mind. ‘Ashini’ means ‘to swallow’. She swallows such cravings and desires. For this reason it is essential to be in Her presence, as far as possible.\n\n3)  Madana also means ‘madness’. Here madness refers to the various different mental illnesses that are entertained in the mind. She plucks them out and renders her devotee free from madness."
