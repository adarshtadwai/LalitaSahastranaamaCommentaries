  "name_transliterated": "Priya-vratā",
  "meaning": "She is very fond of vows and disciplines (vrata).",
  "commentary": "Those who undertake every task allotted to them with the attitude that it is a service (seva) to the Supreme Lord are actually performing a vrata. She is especially fond of such vratas.\n\nPrinces Priyavratā and Uttānapāda were brothers. Being the eldest, Priyavratā was entitled to the crown. However Priyavratā was deeply interested in penance. As such he crowned his brother as the king of the land and went away to the forests to pursue his penance. After many years of penance, he was blessed with the vision of the Divine Mother. But the Supreme Mother was angry. She said that he had left his discarded his duties of kingship with a desire for self-liberation and this was the reason for her anger. Completion of allotted duties is a must. No one should try to escape this. Hearing this, Priyavratā went back, reclaimed his kingdom and ruled ably. Along with his duties, he continued his worship. The Divine Mother re-appeared before him and said that She was truly pleased with him.\n\nEvery vrata is important. Fasting on Ekadashi is a vrata and the question of non-abidance does not apply in this matter."
