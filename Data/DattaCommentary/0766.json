  "commentary": "a) She glows like the hibiscus (mandara, Japā-pushpa) flower. This flower is very dear to Her.\n\nb) From the usage of the word Japā-pushpa, it is implied that worship (dhyana, yoga or surya namaskaras) undertaken in the early hours of the day is very dear to Her. The prayer to the Lord Sun also begins with the word- Japā kusuma sankāsham.\n\nWorship/ dhyana performed at the Sunrise time rewards the person with brightness, peace, better meditative concentration etc. Both sunrise and sunset are extremely auspicious times and hence should be used for worship."
