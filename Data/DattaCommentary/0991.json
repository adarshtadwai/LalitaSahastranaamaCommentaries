  "commentary": "a) She is over and above (ateeta) the six methods of worship (षडध्वा)। ((ṣaḍadhvā).)\n\nThere are many paths to reach the goal. The goal however remains the same – it is to enjoy the supreme bliss. The षडध्वास् (ṣaḍadhvās) are -pada (words), bhuvana (worlds), varna (alphabet), tattva (essence), kala (aspect) and mantra (seed letters). She is over and above all these six.\n\nb) She is over and above the six Chakras (Shat chakras) and over the above the 6 senses (5 senses coupled with the mind).\n\nShe is the supreme power that is over and above every known/visible or understandable logic. She is beyond these planes of existence (lokateeta), above all traits (gunateeta), above all forms of worship and is sarvateeta. These paths are all the ways to reach Her for there is no other path to reach Her."
