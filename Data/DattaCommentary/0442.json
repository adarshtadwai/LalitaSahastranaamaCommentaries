  "name_transliterated": "Kumāra-gaṇanāthāmbā",
  "meaning": "She is the mother of Kumāra (Lord Subrahmanya or Kumaraswamy) and Gananātha (Ganapati).",
  "commentary": "Maharishi Sanatkumara was born as Kumaraswamy to this divine couple Shiva Parvati. It is said that the Supreme Mother herself went in search of Sanatkumara and sought that he should be born to her. Sanatkumara is He who is eternally young.\n\nThe story of the birth of Ganesha and of his acquiring the elephant head is very well known.\n\nOne of our ancient customs dictates that every time elders pay us a visit, it is mandatory to stand up and welcome them. The life energy (prana shakti) of the younger host tends to rise up and float in the air above the head whenever elders pay him/her a visit. Upon standing up and greeting the elders properly, the life force (prana shakti) that is hovering above the head re-enters the head. Else life energy continues to float in the air. The net result is that the life span by about a day stands reduced in the younger host."
