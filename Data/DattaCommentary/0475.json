The temple for Dākini Devi is situated at Bangladesh.\n\nRasa (lymph), rakta (blood), maasa (muscle) medha (adipose tissue) asti (bone) majja (bone marrow) shukra (semen) ni dhatava- these are the 7 primary constituents (dhatus) which sustain the entire body. Without any of these, the body will simply collapse. Vishuddha chakra is the seat for the Rasa dhatu (lymph), which is the first among all the 7 constituents (dhatus)."
