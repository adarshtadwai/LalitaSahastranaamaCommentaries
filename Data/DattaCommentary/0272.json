  "number": 272,
  "name_devanagari": "सदाशिवा",
  "name_transliterated": "Sadāśivā",
  "meaning": "As Sadāśivā, She performs the 5th task of Anugraha.",
  "commentary": "Sadāshivā can be split as sat+ā+shiva. ‘Sat’ is that which is eternal, deathless. ‘Aa’ is complete. ‘Shiva’ is He who grants auspiciousness. Therefore Sadāshivā is the Lord who spares the being from further re-births and grants everlasting and complete liberation (sampoorna moksha). He grants complete auspiciousness. This is the anugraha (blessing). The devotee through his spiritual efforts and good deeds can achieve such a state.\n\nSadāshiva and Sadāshivā refers to the same energy in the male and female forms respectively. Reaching this Lord is the sole aim of every life. He is of peaceful temperament and limitless compassion and should be visualized as such.\n\nThe names of Shiva, Eshwara and Rudra appear confusing. All these three 3 Lords resemble significantly, nevertheless based on their tasks performed, they are 3 different forces."
