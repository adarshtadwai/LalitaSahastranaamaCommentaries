  "name_devanagari": "पञ्चब्रह्मस्वरुपिणी",
  "name_transliterated": "Pañca-brahma-svarūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "He, who by His mere presence causes our body, mind, intellect, antahkarana (inner mind), and senses (indriyas) to move is Brahma. He is the root for our existence, our movement and our action, thoughts as well as our intellect.",
  "commentary": "In the earlier name we have discussed about the state of total merger, wherein even the Devatas merge into Parabrahma. Parabrahma alone exists at this point. After a certain period of time Parabrahma decides to once start the creation. At once, the 5 Devatas get the chaitanya (life force, consciousness) and begin their tasks. Now that they are full of life force (chaitanya), they are no longer referred to as pretas (lifeless) but are now addressed as ‘Brahma’.\n\nWhat are the traits of Brahma? Who is eligible to be adored as Brahma? The following verse clarifies this –\n\nअनपन्न विकारस्सण् अयस्कान्ताव देव यहबुध्याधेएन् छालयेतस्तु तद् ब्रह्मेत्य वधारय (Anapanna vikārassaṇ ayaskāntāva deva yahaBudhyādheen chālayetastu tad brahmetya vadhāraya)\n\nYasya sannidhi mātrena dehendriya manodhiyahaViśayeśu pravartante tad brahmet yavadhāraya\n\nSuch is the great responsibility entrusted to these Lords. These Brahmas, who are the root behind this creation, spend their entire time mediating upon the Supreme Mother; in fact they are the manifestations of the Divine Mother.\n\n‘Swa’ means atma (self); ‘roopini’ means form; they are manifestations of Her forms."
