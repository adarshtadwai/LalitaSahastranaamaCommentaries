  "commentary": "To followers of a Guru, Guru is Mahā-pūjyā. Many families follow the tradition of setting aside a ‘Guru tamboola’ at every festival irrespective of whether the Guru is physically present or not. This is to show their reverence towards Him. Sant Kabirdas, when questioned, replied that His first pooja would be to His Guru and only then to God (Govinda); because his Guru had created in him the worthiness to see God and then had shown to him God. So to him, Guru was the most revered.\n\nThis name also highlights Her form as a Guru."
