  "name_transliterated": "Viyadādi-jagat-prasūḥ",
  "meaning": "Beginning with the sky (akasha or viyat), She has created this entire universe (jagat).",
  "commentary": "The Taittiriya Upanishad states- Atmana आकास्हः (ākāshaḥ) sambhuta- i.e. Paramatma at first created space. From the space other elements such as air, fire, water etc. were created.\n\nViyat Vishnu pādam vāpi- Space (viyat) is Vishnu’s feet (pādam). Space clearly proves that God is all pervading. To be broad-minded means to be able to see this ‘God element’ in each and every object within this universe."
