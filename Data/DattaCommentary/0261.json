  "meaning": "In the deep sleep state the Supreme Mother takes on the name Prājnā.",
  "commentary": "Recollecting these 3 states of existence is in itself a form of dhyana. The above-mentioned 3 states occur naturally to every being. The truth is that there is yet another state of existence; the state that each being aspires to reach. Yet this 4th state is such that it should be earned through efforts. It is the stage of Tureeya.\n\nTo reach Tureeya state, the time allocated for sleep should be reduced.  The attempts for the 4th stage should be made from the 1st stage i.e. the stage of wakefulness (jāgarana). Dream and deep sleep states only take the being away from this 4th stage.\n\nMany of our experiences with divinity happen during our dream state. This is because we are not yet ready to have such experience directly in our waking state. When blessed with such a good/ auspicious dream, the person should instantly wake up, try to recollect the dream and experience it. It is wrong to go back to sleep after an auspicious dream. Even if we are inconvenienced due to inadequate sleep for that night, it is very important to wake up and experience that dream. Likewise, when troubled by a bad dream the person should wake up instantly, drink a glass of water and cool down. Sleeping a little time later will prevent that dream from repeating."
