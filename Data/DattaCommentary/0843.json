  "name_devanagari": "भवचक्रप्रवर्तिनी",
  "name_transliterated": "Bhava-cakra-pravartinī",
  "meaning": "She is the cause of this bhava chakra (cycle of births and deaths, samsara).",
  "commentary": "This samsara is an endless cycle. It can be compared to a terrible and endlessly rotating giant wheel. We puppets can’t even jump out of it. Only he, who completely surrenders to Her can escape from it.\n\nTo those who understand Her essence and seek Her protection, She is ‘भव-रोगघ्नीऽ (‘Bhava-rogaghnī’) (She burns away the samsara); in its absence She is ‘भव-चक्र-प्रवर्तिनीऽ (‘Bhava-cakra-pravartinī’) (the cause of this samsara). If She wills, She can grant peace of mind and calmness to the devotee even before the wheel comes to a halt.\n\nSamsara together with all its entrapments emerges purely out of bhava (thoughts, intentions, feelings and emotions). For this reason pure feelings (bhava) should only be entertained. The Divine Mother is Bhāvajñā (aware of our innermost intentions and thoughts) and based on this She can either cause the bondages or give relief from it."
