  "commentary": "Among the Divine Mother’s foremost disciples is Manmatha (Lord of desires). This lord stirs up our mind causing desires, thoughts, intentions (sankalpas) and doubts (vikalpas) within us. He rules over us. No emperor of this universe, however mighty he could be, can equal Him as He can stir up even the emperor’s mind and cause havoc. The Supreme Mother controls even this all-powerful Lord Manmatha.\n\nThis is explained in Soundarya Lahiri in the stanza –Dhanun paushpam maurvi madhu-kara-mayi pancha visikhaIt is said that this lord of desires is empowered just by the casual looks that are merely cast upon him by the Divine Mother. What more is needed to describe Her energy & strength better? Through Manmatha as a medium, it is She who, in fact, rules this creation."
