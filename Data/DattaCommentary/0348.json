  "number": 348,
  "name_devanagari": "वन्द्या",
  "name_transliterated": "Vandyā",
  "meaning": "She is worshipful, venerable.",
  "commentary": "(Pronouncing this as Vandhya alters the meaning totally and hence is a grave mistake.)\n\nShe is worthy of all receiving all the obeisance (namaskarams) and worship. She is ardently worshipped with Vandana mantras. Vandana mudra and vandana kriya is of utmost importance. Both obeisance and worship (puja) are activities for internal cleansing. In certain pujas extensive namaskaras are offered. The intent behind this is to attain bhava and chitta shuddha (purity of thought/ feeling and mind)."
