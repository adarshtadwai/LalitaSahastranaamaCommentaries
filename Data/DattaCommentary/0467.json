  "name_transliterated": "Śūkṣmarūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "The senses (indriyas) are very subtle. Subtler than them is the mind. Subtler than this mind is the intellect (buddhi) and the one who is far subtler than this intellect and that which controls it, is Paramatma.Being physically unmanifest, the spiritual centers (chakras), are invisible to the naked eye. Inward vision (antar drishti) is the sole means to spot them.",
  "commentary": "The 3rd chapter of Bhagavad Gita states-\n\nindriyani parany ahur indriyebhyah param manahmanasas tu para buddhir yo buddheh paratas tu sah\n\nLalita Sahasranama now takes the aspirant completely into the path of the six spiritual centers (shat chakras), inner meditation and yoga. Visualizing these 6 Chakras in the various selected points within the body is a very superior form of yoga. Filling them with the life energy (prana shakti) and travelling in the path of the Sushumna nadi to reach the Sahasrara is known as the path of yoga. Contemplation of the six chakras (shat chakra dhyana) is undertaken so as to awaken and enable the Kundalini energy (spiritual energy) travel in the path of Sushumna.\n\nThe following 6 namas Vajreśvarī to Siddha-maata are the 6 names/ forms taken on by the Divine Mother to reside within the 6 chakras. The 7th name Yashaswini describes Her ultimate location/position in the Sahasrara chakra. Seated within us in the form of these spiritual mothers, She protects and aids in the formation of the foetus during the first seven months of pregnancy."
