  "meaning": "O Divine Mother!  The dust under your feet washes away all darkness from the mind of the ignorant. They are the heaps of Chintamani (wish fulfilling) gems that are showered on the poorest of men. Just as Lord Varaha’s tusks brought up the earth at the time when it was sinking, your holy feet pull up those who are drowned in this ocean called samsara.",
  "commentary": "Let us understand the meaning contained in the 3 stanza of Soundarya Lahari-\n\nAvidyanam antas-timira-mihira-dweeppa-nagariJadanam chaitanya-stabaka-makaranda-sruti jhariDaridranam cinta-mani-gunanika janma-jaladhauNimadhanam damshtra mura-ripu-varahasya bhavati.\n\nThus the Supreme Mother Vārāhi using Her tusks pulls up the ignorant devotee and pushes him towards supreme knowledge."
