  "commentary": "a) She is the ruler (eshwari) of the Vamāchāra.\n\nVamāchāra in its correct usage, is a form of Bhairava upasana (worship of Lord Bhairava/ Shiva). Lord Shiva himself is the teacher for this branch of knowledge. There are certain definite procedures through which this upasana should be undertaken. Then it is a holy approach. Nowadays, it is being misused purely to gain some temporal powers (siddhis). This is wrong.\n\nb) Vamakās are certain deities who wear tiger skin, decorate their bodies with ashes, hold the skull in their hands etc. They are ardent worshippers of Shiva. As their ruler, She is Vāmakeśwarī."
