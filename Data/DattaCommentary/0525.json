  "name_transliterated": "Hamsavatī-mukhya śakti-samanvitā",
  "meaning": "At the Ajna chakra She is accompanied by two deities Hamsavati and Kshmāvati (also known as mukhya shakti).",
  "commentary": "Ajna Chakra is a two- petalled lotus and these two petals represent these deities.\n\nHamsavati is the life energy (prana shakti). Kshamā stands for the traits of forbearance (patience) and forgiveness. These are primary and essential traits and hence have been aptly addressed as mukhya shakti (primary energies).\n\nThe yogi who reaches this Ajna Chakra should be able to easily forgive and forbear every situation. To be able to adapt and adjust to any given situation and to transform it favourably is the trait of a yogi. In forbearance and tolerance the yogi should be at par with Mother Earth. The Divine Mother blesses him with these traits at this stage."
