  "commentary": "Hrdaya is the akasha (space) where Chit (Jnana) shines eternally like the Sun. The efforts of the aspirant ensure its glow.\n\nYathaanegro ja beejasthaa shakti ropo mahaa drumahaTathaa hrdaya beejastham jagadetat charaacharam.\n\nThis entire world is perceived by the being purely because of the existence of the mind and the heart. Where the mind does not exist, the world will cease to be visible. Hence mind and the heart are the seed within which this creation exists."
