  "meaning": "She cures all the diseases both physical (vyādhi) and mental (ādhi).",
  "commentary": "Mental sickness and troubles arise out of dissatisfaction or discontent in the mind. Such discontent is also the root for depression. It is an unhealthy attitude and should never be entertained. A person who really wants to be depressed can afford to be depressed about not reaching God. This in fact will motivate him and cause him to work harder towards this spiritual goal."
