  "meaning": "She is as beautiful as Rati, the wife of Manmatha (God of Love) or She has taken on the form of Rati.When Manmatha was reduced to ashes (refer introduction), his wife Rati fervently prayed to the Supreme Mother and composed many hymns (Rati stotram). Through these hymns she sought to know the faults for which her husband was thus punished and begged that he should be restored to life. Manmatha is Lakshmi Devi’s son. Rati as such is her daughter-in-law. Taking on the form of Rati (Ratiroopa) implies that She has placed herself in Rati’s shoes and thereby understands her grief. This highlights the beautiful relationship that she shares with her daughter-in-law.",
