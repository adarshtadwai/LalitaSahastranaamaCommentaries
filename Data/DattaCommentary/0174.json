  "commentary": "Bhava is a synonym for samsāra. In common understanding samsāra refers to spouse, children, property, career and other related aspects that bind us in this worldly life. But samsāra is not just limited to these. Samsāra can be split into sam+sārah. Sārah refers to a flow. ‘Samsāra’ therefore means ‘an endless flow’.\n\nThe only aspect that has an endless flow is ‘birth’ (janma) as one birth follows another to in an endless stream and this is the true samsāra.\n\nThe Divine Mother is eternal and therefore over and above this samsara (bhava)."
