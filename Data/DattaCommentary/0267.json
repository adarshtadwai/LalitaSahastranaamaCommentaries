As a protector of all the living things (‘Go’), She is Govinda. She has ordained, Vishnu, one of the five Brahmas, with this task of sustenance and protection of this creation and hence He is addressed as Govinda. Krishna, who protected everyone by holding up the Mountain Govardhana was praised as Govinda."
