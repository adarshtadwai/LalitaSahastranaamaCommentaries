  "name_transliterated": "Pāparaṇya-davānalā",
  "meaning": "She is the fire who reduces to ashes the heaps (forest) of sins of Her devotees.",
  "commentary": "Every person should, prior to retiring to bed, write down all his/her karmas done during the day. The acts by which he/she hurt others or the good deeds by which he could help others on that day should be mandatorily recollected. Such conscious recollection prevents the repetition of the misdeeds and encourages the good deeds.\n\nExtensive Pranayama burns out heaps of sins. Pranayama should be undertaken until the body is fully drenched with sweat. The body vibrates when the supply of prana shakti is stopped. Such vibration is the repentance (prayaschitta) for the sins/ bad deeds.\n\nThe human mind generally chases sins. Our mind should be trained to see good in bad. Good deeds should be undertaken as they wipe out the heaps of sins. Fear of sin prevents the mind from chasing them. Love towards dharma and fear towards sins (dharma preeti- paapa bheeti) are essential sutras for spiritual path."
