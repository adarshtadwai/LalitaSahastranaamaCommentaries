  "name_transliterated": "Trivarga nilayā",
  "meaning": "There are only 3 main planes of existence (lokas, worlds). They are the Bhu loka, Bhuvar loka and Suvar loka. All other planes merge into them. All the planes below the earth (bhu) merge into the Bhu loka (earth plane). All the planes above merge into the Bhuvar loka. The entire space (antareeksha) merges into the Suvar loka.",
  "commentary": "Amongst the four-fold aims of life, the fourth i.e. liberation (Moksha), has been eliminated here as it is not a pre-requisite for this worldly life.\n\nTrayolokas trayodevas trayah paavaka trayamTrinee jyotimshchi vargascha trayo dharmas tathaTrayo gunah trayo sabdah trayoh doshah tatha ashramah.Trayah kAlah tatha avasthah pitarah ahar nishAdayah.\n\nSimilarly, the 3 main deities are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (trayo-devah). There are 3 sacrificial fires (tretāgnis). There are 3 types of illumination- Sun, Moon and Fire, 3vargās -dharma, artha and kaama, 3 gunas (traits, qualities)- Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, 3 Doshās, 3 āshramās- brahmacharya, grihasta and vānaprastha (sanyasi is not included as it is not a pre-requisite for this worldly life but is connected to attaining salvation), 3 times (trikāla) – past, present and future, 3 stages of experience- waking state, dream state and deep sleep state, 3 planes of existence for the forefathers – vasu, rudra and ādityah and 3 Sandhya times – morning, midday and evening.\n\nThe world is thus based upon such groups of three. Each of these 3 gets sub-divided into 3 and the combination is (3*3) 9. For this reason 9 is considered a complete number in this creation. To emphasize this, the Supreme Mother is worshipped as Nava-durga; Navaratri festivals are celebrated for 9 nights; Navavarana puja is performed and so on. 9 also is the last independent numeral- after this all the numbers are combinations of the original set of numbers."
