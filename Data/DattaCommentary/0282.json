  "name_transliterated": "Sahasra-śīrṣa-vadanā",
  "meaning": "She wears thousand heads and thousand faces.",
  "commentary": "Sahasra (thousand) denotes infinity. It means that She has innumerable heads and faces. In the Purusha sooktam of the Vedas, the Supreme entity is addressed as- सहस्रशीर्षा (sahasraśīrṣā) पुरुषः (puruṣaḥ) सहस्राक्षः (sahasrākṣaḥ) sahasrapāt’.\n\nThe dwarf form of that Almighty is known as Vamana. In the Vamana avatara (one of the 10 incarnations of Lord Maha Vishnu), the Lord who initially was as infinitesimal as a thumb suddenly covered the entire land and space with 3 steps. He expanded into the Trivikrama form (Tri (three)+ vikrama (steps to cross the lokas)). This incarnation teaches that creation, which was until then the size of an atom or sub-atom, suddenly expanded. The Lord suddenly took on various forms and spread Himself throughout the creation. He now had infinite heads, eyes, faces and so on."
