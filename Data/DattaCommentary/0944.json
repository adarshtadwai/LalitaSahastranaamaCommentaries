  "commentary": "a) Her mind is as firm as a diamond (vajra). She renders the minds of the sādhakās firm.\n\nTo progress in sādhana, the mind should be absolutely firm. Without firm determination, no progress can ever be made. The Divine Mother hardens the Mooladhāra chakra and enables the person to progress in his yoga sādhanā.\n\nb) Sachi Devi is known as Vajrini. She is the wife/energy of Indra who holds the Vajrāyudha (diamond weapon) in his hand."
