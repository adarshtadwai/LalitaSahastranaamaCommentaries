  "meaning": "O Divine Mother! You move from the Mooladhaara, your official residence, you reach the Sahasrara and there you drench all the naadis of the body with the nectar. Thereafter you return back to your residence the Kula Kunda where you sleep.",
  "commentary": "The Mooladhāra is the fire pit (home bowl, kunda) of spiritual kundalini energy. Just as offerings (ahuti) are made to the visible fire in the homa bowl, breath in the form of Pranayama is offered to this Mooladhāra chakra. Inhalation through the process of Pranayama is the offering of the material for the homa within. The Kundalini energy is sleeping coiled at this chakra. Awakening and pushing it through the Sushumna channel is possible only through Pranayama. Pranayama is a must for every person desirous of proceeding in the yogic path. Offering the breath (Prana) that is taken in during the Pranayama to the Kundalini Mother seated at the Mooladhāra is known as Prāna yagna.\n\nKula-kunda also refers to the triangle (Trikona). Homa kunda for Devi’s upasana is often drawn like a triangle. When we are seated either in Padmasana or sukhasana, the position resembles a triangle.\n\nSoundarya lahiri praises this Divine Mother in the stanza –\n\nSudha-dhara-sarais carana-yugalanta vigalitaihPrapancham sinchanti punarapi ras’amnaya-mahasah;Avapya svam bhumim bhujaga-nibham adhyusta-valayamSvam atmanam krtva svapishi kulakunde kuharini"
