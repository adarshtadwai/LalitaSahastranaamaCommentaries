  "name_transliterated": "Pārvatī",
  "meaning": "She is the daughter of the Himalayas (Himavat putri).",
  "commentary": "Her birth as a daughter of a mountain establishes Her connection as well as Her authority over the non-living or inanimate objects of the universe. This name is interlinked with the name Charāchara-jagannāthā (247th name).\n\n‘Achala’ means ‘that which does not move’- mountains being immobile (achara) are also known as achala as in Simhāchala, Dronāchala, Bhadrāchala etc. When the intellect (buddhi) is brought to the state of absolute immobility (achala, motionless), the Supreme Lord enters and resides in it. These mountains with temples located upon them subtly teach us such an important lesson!"
