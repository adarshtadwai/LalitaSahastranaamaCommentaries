  "number": 300,
  "name_devanagari": "नामरूपविवर्जिता",
  "name_transliterated": "Nāma-rūpa-vivarjitā",
  "meaning": "She is over and above name (nāma) and form (roopa).",
  "commentary": "The 5 aspects (characteristics) of the Supreme entity are- 1) Nāma (name) 2) Roopa (form), 3) Asti (eternal existence) 4) Bhati (knowledge) 5) Priyam (ananda or bliss).\n\nName and form are acquired aspects while the other three are inherent eternal aspects. The Supreme entity at the final state is devoid of these two acquired traits of name and form. He remains then as sat (asti), chit (bhati) and ananda (priyam).\n\nAt the end stage of Sadhana, the aspirant goes over the limitations of name and form and merges into the infinite purely either through music or knowledge.\n\nName and form (roopa) are essential at the earliest stages of spiritual practices as they help the aspirant stabilize in his path. They pave the way towards nāda. The aspirant visualizes Her as a form as sound and is further lead to have the vision of Nārayani.\n\nWith this 299th name, the 3rd compound has been crossed over and we are entering the 4th compound (āvarana). The song Bhavaya chitte (Tripura cassette) is suited to this stage. This is the stage of music (nāda) and dance. The last name of the previous enclosure, explained that She is above name and form and is a form of music (nāda). The names from now on take a new level. That She is an embodiment of mantra, a support for this creation, a beejākshara (seed letter) and a shakti (energy) are now explained. Lalita Sahasranama teaches that She is even subtler than the causal body (kārana shareera) and that She is the cause of all causes (sarva kārana kāranam)."
