  "meaning": "Every being is born out of food, sustains on this earth with the aid of food and upon death once again merges back into food. Food is the root of everything. It is food that is being born and it is food that is growing.",
  "commentary": "Sahasrara describes Her infinite and all pervasive state. Aptly, at this point, offering of any type of food (sarva odana) is dear to Her.\n\nTo a yogi who has reached this stage, there are no differences of any kind. He is beyond all limitations. He sees himself everywhere and in everyone.\n\nAnna (food) is Parabrahma. Taitareeya Upanishad states-Annam brahmeti vyajanāt annādhyeva khalvamāni bhootani jāyanteAnnena jātāni jīvanti annam prayantyabhisamvishanti\n\nFood (anna) should never be wasted, insulted and disrespected. Every aspect of food preparation plays a significant role in formation of our attitude. It is said that its influence begins right from the place from where it has been purchased. The conditions, cleanliness and the purity with which it has been cooked, the feelings of the person preparing the food, the feelings of the person serving the food, the environment in which the food is being served, the feelings of the person consuming the food, all of these play a role in the formation of the gunas (traits) within the person. For this reason, consumption of food should be with an attitude of yagna.\n\nThe food prepared in complete purity is offered to Her with together with the recitation of the Swahaa mantra. Offering of every form of food (anna) preparation is very dear to Her."
