Sins likewise are reduced to ashes within a second with Her grace.",
  "commentary": "Meruparvata mātropi rāśih pāpasya karmanahKatyāyini samāsādya naśyati kśna mātratah.\n\nComplete concentration/dedication in worship, immense faith and undoubted devotion are the most important pre-requisites to acquire this state.\n\nWhat is merit (punya) and what is sin (pāpā)? Veda Vyasa has declared – That which hurts/ troubles others is sin. Helping others and ensuring their happiness, even if it is at the cost of one’s own happiness is Punya.\n\nPujas and other forms of worship act as a protective shield (kavacha) that prevents the person from committing sins."
