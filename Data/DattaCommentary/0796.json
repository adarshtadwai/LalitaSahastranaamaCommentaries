  "name_transliterated": "Kāmarūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "कामरूपिणी (Kāmarūpiṇī) means She can assume any form as per Her will.",
  "commentary": "All the various deities/ Gods are Her forms that She has taken on as per Her will. She has also manifested in the form of this universe.\n\nThe ability to take on a form per will exists in both Gods as well as in demons. For example Demoness Surpanakha in Ramayana could take on a form per will. However the form taken on by the demons is born out of desires and is short lived. Krishna too took on different forms to appease the needs of the various devotees. The form that he took depended not upon His desire (need) but was based on the desires of the devotees."
