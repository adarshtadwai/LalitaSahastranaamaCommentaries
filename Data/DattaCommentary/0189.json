  "commentary": "1) She is beyond the reach of this physical body.\n\n‘Gama’ means ‘the path to be traversed’. One cannot walk on this spiritual path with the physical body. The mind and the intellect (buddhi) walk on this path. This physical body is a very important tool that aids in this.She can be easily reached through internal worship (antar yāga). External worship is just an aid to inner worship but is not an end in itself. Where the mind and intellect do not participate in the external worship, no results can be obtained.\n\n2) She destroyed the Demon Durgama (Durgamāsura) and hence is addressed as Durgamā."
