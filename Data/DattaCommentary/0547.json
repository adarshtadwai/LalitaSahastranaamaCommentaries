  "name_devanagari": "बर्बरालका",
  "name_transliterated": "Bandhūrālakā",
  "meaning": "It is the various deeds of the past lives that protect a person wherever he is, whether he is in a forest, in a war, in water, in fire, deep in an ocean, on the hill-top, whether he is awake or asleep or in any dangerous situation.",
  "commentary": "Bandhūrālakā can also be read as Barbarālakā.\n\nHair is symbolic of kāla (time). All beings are trapped within this time (kāla). The curls in Her hair symbolize the ups and downs or the waves of ignorance and bondages in our life. She destroys these bondages and uplifts the devotees.\n\nThe entire verse starting from पुण्यकीर्तिः (Puṇyakīrtiḥ) (542) up to Bandhūrālakā (547) explains about the rewards earned due to performance of good deeds. Akin to Pulomaja, every earnest devotee will be rescued. Such essence is also summed up in the following neeti (moral)-\n\nvane rane shatrujalaagnimadhyemahaarnnave parvatamastake vaasuptam pramattam vishamasthitam vaarakshanti punyaani puraakritaani\n\nThis above verse teaches the importance of acquiring virtue in the lifetime. Simultaneously it is essential to undertake repentance (prayaschitta) for the mistakes and sins of the past. The name Pulomajārcitā teaches this."
