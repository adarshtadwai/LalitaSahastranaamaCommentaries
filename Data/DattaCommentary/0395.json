  "meaning": "She is very famous. The Supreme Knowledge and its effulgence are inherently well known to every being.",
  "commentary": "The most common misconception that every being possesses is that the spiritual knowledge is an unknown and distant subject. The truth however is that this is an inherent knowledge that every being possesses. Just as fire and heat are inseparable, the being and the Supreme Knowledge are inseparable. The reality is that the being, having separated from the Paramatma has temporarily forgotten the Supreme Knowledge that is inherently his own. This ignorance causes the being to consider itself as a separate existence.\n\nThis has caused words such as I and mine (Aham) to come into existence. Out of ignorance, the being uses the word ‘I’ at the individual level to express his identity. When the same ‘I’ is used at the universal (virat) level, the Supreme Knowledge comes back to memory. One should practice universal oneness; learn to see his self in every object of this creation. This is universal ahamkara. This is the change that the Sadguru strives to bring about in his student."
