They are the traits of purity (sattva guna).\n\nThe structure of a person alters slowly based on the actions that he performs and the type of Sadhana that he undertakes. With a dedicated sattvik activities and upasana, the person begins to attract tendencies of purity towards him and slowly his structure undergoes a change.
