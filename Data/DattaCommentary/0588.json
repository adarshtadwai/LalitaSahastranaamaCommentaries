  "meaning": "She is the trikūta- the combined state of all the 3 kūtas.",
  "commentary": "The 15-syllable mantra of the Divine Mother is divided into 3 kūtas – Vagbhava kūta, Madhya kūta and Shakti kūta.\n\nRamayana states that Hanuman lands on the Trikūta Mountain when he reaches Lanka in search of Sita. Trikūta being referred to here in the story is actually the Supreme Mother’s 15- syllabled divine mantra. In reality, Mother Sita is the Supreme Mother Rajarajeshwari. She was found when King Janaka was ploughing the fields and hence came to be known as his daughter. Landing on Trikūta Mountain symbolized that Hanuman had achieved accomplishment of this 15-syllabled (Panchadashee, Trikūta) mantra.\n\nThis is to state that those who undertake the sadhana of the Trikūta mantra will be blessed with Her vision."
