  "name_transliterated": "Pañca-kośāntra-sthitā",
  "meaning": "She is seated within the 5 sheaths (Pancha koshās).",
  "commentary": "The living beings are made up of 5 sheaths also known as koshas. They are in the order of Annamaya kosha, Prānamaya kosha, Manomaya kosha, Vignānamaya kosha and Anandamaya kosha. The term kosha means enclosure, avarana, layer or covering. Each sheath is subtler than the one preceding it.\n\nThe outermost sheath covering the being is the sheath of food or Annamaya kosha. This is the physical body. This enclosure is created out of the food (anna) that the being partakes. The being originates out of food and it is out of food that he sustains.\n\nThe second is the Prānamaya kosha or the sheath of vital energy. The vital energy enters and enables the being to connect to the external world. It controls the vital actions of the being. The third is the Manomaya kosha or the sheath of mind. It is at the level of thoughts and emotions and thus controls the fourth and fifth sheaths (prānamaya and annamaya koshas).The fourth is the Vignanamaya kosha- the sheath of experience. The combination of food, vital energy and mind give the being an experience. This is the vignana. He develops the feeling of ‘I’ (individual identity). This is the process through which all beings are created.\n\nAnandamaya kosha is the sheath of bliss. This is the fifth and subtlest of all the sheaths. This is purely to be experienced.\n\nShe resides within these sheaths.\n\nWith this name, the Śivadūtī vidya concludes. These 24 names corresponded to the 24 syllables in the Gayatri Mantra (which is said to represent the 24 cosmic principles).\n\nIn the names below, the form of the Divine Mother Gayatri is extolled."
