  "name_transliterated": "Śivadūtī",
  "meaning": "She, to whom Lord Shiva himself is a doota (messenger), is Śivadūtī.",
  "commentary": "Shiva signifies auspiciousness and prosperity. Repeating His name attracts auspiciousness for the inner being (atma). Before the war with Demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, She sent Shiva as a messenger asking the demons to give up their bad ways. For having sent Shiva as a messenger She is Śivadūtī.\n\n‘Sending Shiva’ means ‘sending auspiciousness’ to the demons. It means giving them a chance to develop good traits. God always gives a chance for even the worst sinner to develop good traits. When the demons failed to heed the good advice, She had to attack and kill them."
