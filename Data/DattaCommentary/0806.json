  "meaning": "Illumination is of various forms- the inner light/illumination (antar jyoti), the external light (bahir jyoti) and individual illumination (pratyak jyoti). Such illumination is ageless (eternal, sanātana). It is the foundation for all other types of illumination and is self-ignited (swayam jyotih, which does not need support). Such illumination is the illumination of the self (atma-jyoti) who is none other than Shiva himself (shivosmyaham)!",
  "commentary": "While lighting the oil lamp, the following verse should be recited-\n\nॐ अन्तर्-ज्योतिह् बहिर्-ज्योतिह् प्रत्यक्-ज्योतिह् सनातनह्ज्योतिर्-ज्योतिह् स्wअयम्-ज्योतिह् आत्म-ज्योतिह् स्हिवोस्म्यहम् (Om antar-jyotih bahir-jyotih pratyak-jyotih sanātanahJyotir-jyotih swayam-jyotih ātma-jyotih shivosmyaham)\n\nLighting the lamp in the evening before God has a great spiritual significance. Even though the house is completely illuminated with electrical lamps, this practice of lighting the oil lamp should not be given up. This oil lamp is considered as Parabrahma itself!"
