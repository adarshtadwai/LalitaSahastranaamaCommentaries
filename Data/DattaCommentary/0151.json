  "commentary": "The Supreme Parabrahma, who is here being described in a female form of Supreme Mother, is deathless, omnipresent, has no limitations of any kind.\n\n2) Nirantara is that which does not require a reason/ motive for its existence although it provides an opportunity for others to exist.\n\nJust as the limitless space provides an opportunity for the solar system and other creations to exist within it, the Supreme Mother provides an opportunity for others to exist, although She herself does not need any support for Her existence."
