  "name_devanagari": "तमोऽपहा",
  "name_transliterated": "Tamopaha",
  "meaning": "She destroys absolute ignorance (tamo guna).",
  "commentary": "Laziness, sleep, procrastination, inertia, lack of interest in any task, lack of faith in anything, complete ignorance, complete maya (illusion, delusion), absolutely being bound by attachments and bondages (moha) are all traits of tamo guna. When all these traits accumulate at one place, it is dreadful darkness and is a state of absolute tamoguna. It is a very dangerous state.\n\nShe destroys these traits in those persons who deeply seek to proceed on the spiritual path but are facing impediments from such inertia. Such persons truly deserve to receive her grace.\n\nWhere the mind is not fully craving for spiritual knowledge and has other desires/ thoughts, it means that the person is not fully ready. Knowledge imparted to such persons will not be retained by their mind. Hence, it is impertinent that first of all mind should be directed towards this. This is the first exercise to be undertaken."
