  "commentary": "Earlier names such as Uma and Gowri glorified the Divine Mother as a little girl. The name Nitya shodashika roopa extolled Her as an eternal young maiden. Now She is being described as an old lady (वृद्धा) ((vṛddhā)) to imply that She has been in existence forever.\n\nb) वृद्धा (Vṛddhā) also means that She has grown into a gigantic form.\n\nIt is the growth of the intellect that is subtly being referred to here. Such enormous form should be visualized purely in the intellect."
