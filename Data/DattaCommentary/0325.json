  "meaning": "She is the root (kanda) for the entire universe (jagat). It can also be interpreted to mean that She is the child (kanda) of this creation (jagat).",
  "commentary": "She is Bāla Tripura Sundari (the Supreme Mother in the form of a small girl).\n\nOur scriptures authoritatively state that in those houses where good music is heard daily, or where good healthy music is practiced or heard regularly or where mantra is worshipped as a form of music, the Supreme Mother roams about as a small child. This teaches us the importance of listening to good music. Through a regular practice of listening to good music, one day the ability to listening to the inner sound from Anahata chakra will be achieved. In addition, it calms the nerves, grants good health and dispels mental stress and worries."
