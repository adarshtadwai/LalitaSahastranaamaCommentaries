  "meaning": "She is the life force for the entire creation (the universal Kundalini).",
  "commentary": "The composite life force (chaitanya, Kundalini) of the entire creation is called Bhogini. ‘Bhoga’ stands for snake. This instantly reminds us of the serpent who is hidden in the Kundalini deep within us. Subrahmanya is the Lord of Yoga (yoga purusha); He is the embodiment of yoga and He blesses his devotee with yoga. He is referred to as a snake.\n\nThe references to Kundalini in the earlier names were about the individual Kundalini. Now the reference is to the Universal Kundalini (the combined Kundalini of the creation). At the universal level this force is called ‘Shesha’, ‘Bhogini’ and ‘Ananta’. At the universal level, this energy is all-pervading and endless (Ananta) and has no remnants (Shesha). It does not suffer from any form of incompleteness.\n\nLord Vishnu seated on the shesha (serpent), implies that the Supreme Lord is seated upon the Kundalini of the entire creation and is driving it.\n\nGreat saints worship for this Bhoga for the spiritual growth of the entire universe."
