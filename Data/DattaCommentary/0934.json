  "number": 934,
  "name_devanagari": "विश्वमाता",
  "name_transliterated": "Viśvamātā",
  "meaning": "She is mother for this entire creation (Vishwa). She is the mother for the waking state, which is also known as Vishwa.",
  "commentary": "There are so many instances in Lalita Sahasranama wherein She is addressed as Māta. Women in general are compassionate even though they display shades of anger, jealousy etc. A woman in the mother’s role is purely full of love and compassion towards her children. So there is a frequent re-iteration of this fact that She is seated in Her position as a mother. Her compassion and love are purely motherly. Approximately after every 100 names, once the reference to Her as a mother occurs. 100 names is one enclosure and to cross it divine help is necessary. Only the mother will pull us up."
