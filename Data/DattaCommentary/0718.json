  "commentary": "Vedas describe the Lord as- ‘Mahīm devīm Vishnupatnīm ajūryām’.\n\nAll living beings born on this earth should make attempts to understand the nature of this life on earth and scrutinize in detail the good as well as the hardships that occur here. To a person who is intoxicated by all these illusory creations of earth, life on earth appears bountiful and joyful. Such a person seeks to be reborn again and again on earth. Such a person is fully trapped in maya!\n\nThese three names of ‘Māyā, Madhumatī and Mahī’ seek to teach us about this worldly illusion and warn us. They seek to instill in us the desire to move away from such entrapments."
