  "name_transliterated": "Bhavānī",
  "meaning": "O Divine Mother Bhavānī! I am your servant. Please cast your compassionate eyes in my direction. Even before the person utters the word Bhavānī completely, you bless him with aikya (state of complete merger into the Absolute). Please also absorb me into you. Bless me with feelings of oneness with you.",
  "commentary": "Bhavānī is one of the very special names of the Supreme Mother. Just thinking of Her as Bhavānī grants immense merit. Ksheerbhavani Devi temple is very famous in Kashmir.\n\nBhavānī is the energy that helps us cross this ocean of samsara (cycle of births and deaths). To achieve this, people undertake ‘Bhavānī deeksha’. In other words, Bhavānī is nothing but the energy otherwise known as ‘Rudra’.\n\nTo emphasize this point, the Vedas declare –\n\nSri Adi Shankaracharya extols the merit of Bhavāni in His composition Soundarya Lahiri in the stanza –bhavāni tvam dāse mayi vitara drshtim sakarunām.."
