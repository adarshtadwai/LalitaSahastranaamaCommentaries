  "meaning": "Commentary:",
  "commentary": "Tirodhāna is a state of absorption (laya) wherein the being (jeevi) is absorbed completely into Her without any remnants or identification. For a certain time, the being remains in that state before taking on another form. When such absorption takes places on a massive scale or when many jeevis (beings) are absorbed completely into Her at the same time, it is known as Pralaya. Pralaya takes place at the end of the Maha kalpa."
