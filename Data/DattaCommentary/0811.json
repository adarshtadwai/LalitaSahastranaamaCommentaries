  "commentary": "Ghrunā lajja bhayam shanka जुहुप्सा (juhupsā) cheti panchamiKulam shīlam तथा (tathā) jatih ashtau pāsha prakīrtitā.\n\nGhrunā- Feelings of disgust, aversion and unnecessary compassion are classified as घ्रुना। (ghrunā.) Compassion should be towards the needy. Undue compassion towards the children spoils them and thus is harmful.\n\nHere, lajja means feeling embarrassed when it is uncalled for. Bhayam means unwanted fear. Both of these are major obstacles for progressing in life. The best example of this is being embarrassed or afraid to collect one’s marks-card.\n\nShanka is to be needlessly doubtful. Juhupsa reflects the hesitation towards the good aspects of life. Kula means to entertain feelings of caste differences.  sheela (character), jati (distinction between male and female) are all unnecessary luggages that are bondages. Unless they are given up spiritual journey is impossible."
