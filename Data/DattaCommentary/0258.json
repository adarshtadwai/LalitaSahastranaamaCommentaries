  "name_devanagari": "स्वपन्ती",
  "name_transliterated": "Swapantī",
  "meaning": "It is She who exists in the dream state (swapna avastha) experienced by the being.",
  "commentary": "In the dream state the being exists in the subtle body (sookśma shareera) and possesses predominantly rajasic traits (rajo guna). The being is still consciousness of its separate existence. The tejas (consciousness) that was experienced by the individual throughout the day in the form of thoughts, the various sounds heard, the actions and feelings have all been registered and absorbed by the subtle body. The mind, which, until then was travelling externally in its expanded form, now contracts and goes within. It continues to function and as a result of this functioning, dreams are experienced. Fictional dreams also arise as a result of some imaginations or assumptions that exist subtly in the mind. The beejakshara (seed letter) for this dream state is ‘U’ Kaara."
