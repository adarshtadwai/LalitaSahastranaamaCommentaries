  "meaning": "She is the form of the 51 shakti peethas.",
  "commentary": "Let us understand how these Shakti peethas came into existence.\n\nSati was the daughter of Daksha and wife of Lord Shiva. Daksha once organized a huge yagna to which everyone barring his son-in-law was invited. Sati Devi went to the yagna being conducted by her father, much against the wishes of Lord Shiva. However, unable to withstand the humiliation that she had to suffer there, she immolated herself. An enraged Shiva went to the place where Daksha was performing his yagna and destroyed it. Daksha was killed by Shiva’s ganas.\n\nShiva, who was in a state of wild grief, carried Sati’s body on his shoulders and roamed all over the world. At the behest of all other Gods, Lord Vishnu severed Sati’s body into 51 pieces with his Sudarshan Chakra (discus), so that Shiva would return to sanity. Parts of her body fell at 51 different places. These places came to be known as Shakti peethas.\n\nAt every Shakti Peetha, Goddess Shakti accompanied by Lord Bhairava (a manifestation of Lord Shiva) resides. At these places Her presence can be felt by eminent yogis. These places have great spiritual significance. Mere recollection of these names grants the merit of visiting the temple.\n\nMost of these temples are in a dilapidated state. Visit to a shakti peetha should mandatorily be accompanied by a visit to the Bhairava temple else the visit is not fruitful."
