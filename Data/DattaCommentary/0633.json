  "commentary": "a) The name Uma contains in it the Omkara.\n\nThe A, U and M of Omkaara are reversed as U, M and A. When Uma is recited continuously, it transforms into Aum.This is an extremely auspicious name.\n\nb) This is the name with which Parvati’s mother addressed her when she was a little girl.\n\nWhen Parvati Devi as a young maiden set out to perform tapas and win Shiva as her husband, Mena Devi, her mother called out to Her as U-ma. ‘U’ is the reference with love to a young girl, and ‘ma’ suggests don’t. It means- ‘O dear, don’t undertake intense tapas. You are a tender and young girl. This is not the age for severe penance’. So she said- ‘U–ma, U-ma’. Without heeding to her mother, young Parvati set out for penance and finally accomplished Her goal.\n\nThis is a lesson to everyone. When others dissuade against spiritual practices, do not give in but carry on your path."
