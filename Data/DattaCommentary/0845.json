  "name_transliterated": "Śāstra-sārā",
  "meaning": "‘Shastra’ means that which teaches the pravritti dharma (duty in the worldly/ external life), the nivritti dharma (duty in spiritual life, inward path), the knowledge about that which is permanent and true (nitya), and that which adopts fictitious examples (krtaka) for our understanding of the supreme truth.",
  "commentary": "‘Understanding the essence’ is the primary criteria behind reading Shastras. The knowledge earned and the spiritual progress achieved through reading should be assessed. Efforts should be put in to grasp the secretive essence contained within. Only then the true fruits of the reading will be delivered.\n\nPravruttir va nivrittir va nityena krtakena vaPumsam yenopathisyeta tat shastra mabhideeyate.\n\nShe is the end result/ fruit of understanding the Shastras! She is Phalanee (Palani)- You are the fruit (phala+nee).\n\nLord Subrahmanya is known as Palani Swamy.  The story is that Narada Maharishi once brought a fruit and offered it to Lord Shiva. Shiva in turn presented it to Parvati Devi. Seeing the fruit in the mother’s hand, both her sons Ganapati and Subrahmanya demanded the fruit in entirety. She gave the fruit to Ganapati. Dejected, Subrahmanya flew away from his home. He settled in Thiru Avinankudi (Tamil Nadu). Shiva and Parvati tried in various means to pacify him but it was of no use. Finally Shiva said to Subrahmanya, “You are the true fruit (phala nee). You are the fruit of all wisdom. You are the fruit of true understanding of Supreme essence. You are the fruit of all the Vedas, Shastras, Yoga, Nama-sankeertan and karma”. He gives the fruits of all this sadhana on to his devotees."
