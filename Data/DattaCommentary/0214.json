  "name_transliterated": "Mahāpātaka-naśinī",
  "meaning": "O Mother! Neither do I know any mantra nor do I have any idea of yantra. I don’t know any hymn (stotra, stuti) either. I have no idea how to invoke you or how to meditate upon you. I know neither your story nor your glory. I do not even know how to weep effectively and properly, so ignorant am I. But I have sought shelter under You, and I know that just following your orders and walking on your path is sufficient to end all troubles and sorrows.",
  "commentary": "Pātaka is that which causes a fall (patanam); it throws a person to lowest levels. It reduces the worthiness of the person (purity) and distances him from divinity. It spoils the mind.\n\nSins (pātaka) are of numerous classifications – Maha-pātakas, upa-pātakas, Jatibranshkarana, Shankarikarana, Apātrikarana and Malinikarana. Among them Maha-pātakas are the worst. Sins that accrue on account of actions such as abortion, killing of women, infants, Brahmins etc. are classified under this. It is immaterial whether such actions are performed knowingly or unknowingly.\n\nShe relieves her ardent devotees from the burden of even such sins.\n\nPraying to God is mainly to destroy the existing sins and to seek protection from committing sins in future. There is a beautiful verse that seeks protection from the Divine Mother in the Durga Stuti –\n\nNa mantram no yantram tadapi cha na jāne stuti-mahona छा-ह्वानम् (chā-hvānam) dhyānam tadapi cha na jāne stuti-kathāhna jāne mudrāste tadapi cha na jāne vilapanamparam jāne मातस्-त्वदनुसरणम् (mātas-tvadanusaraṇam) क्लेश-हरणम् (kleśa-haraṇam)\n\nThe prayer ‘Kayena Vācha’ that is recited at the end of the worship relieves the devotee of sins of omission/ mistakes during the puja, if such a prayer is offered with total devotion."
