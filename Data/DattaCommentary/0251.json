  "meaning": "Jnana is that which glows purely out of its own illumination and without the support of any external illumination (prakasha).",
  "commentary": "She fills these Brahmas with this knowledge. Using them as a medium She executes all tasks related to creation, sustenance and so on.\n\nThe three eternal aspects of Supreme are ‘Sacchidananda’ i.e. Sat, Chit and Ananda. ‘Sat’ means that which is eternal. ‘Chit’ means knowledge. ‘Ananda’ means bliss.\n\nChit is thus an important aspect of Parabrahma. It is the root. Everything stems from knowledge. Knowledge (Jnana) can be defined as ‘understanding, wisdom or experience’. A beautiful definition that summarizes knowledge is –\n\n‘śwetara aprakāśara prakāśatvam jnānam’\n\nKnowledge is self-illuminating and it causes others to glow. A truly knowledgeable person (Jnani) will have nothing left to be learnt from others."
