  "meaning": "She is the intelligence (Jnana, chiti) that exists within each individual being (pratyak).",
  "commentary": "The individual being (the jeevatma) has its own separate existence/ identity and is called the pratyek atma. At the individual level, speech takes on so many individualized forms based on each individual’s knowledge. For this reason, the speech, tone, sound, words used etc. differ from one person to another.\n\nIt is important to understand that the same all-pervading intelligence divides itself into innumerable entities known as individual beings and expresses itself in million varied ways through them."
