  "meaning": "She is hard, firm and resplendent akin to a diamond. Vajreshwari is the presiding deity of Vishuddha chakra (located at the throat).",
  "commentary": "The temple for Vajreshwari Devi is near the Jwala maalini temple in Haryana.\n\nThe mind of an aspirant should be as firm as a diamond before he takes on spiritual practices. Firm faith and belief in success are essential pre-requisites. With total dedication and faith in the words of the Guru, one should put his first steps in this path. There should be no desire for propaganda. The aspirant should have total clarity about the need and benefit of these practices before jumping into it. Such clarity prevents the mind from going haywire during the process of sadhana."
