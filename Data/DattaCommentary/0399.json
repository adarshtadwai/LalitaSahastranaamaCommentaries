  "name_transliterated": "Vyaktāvyakta-svarūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "All beings are in an un-manifest state in the beginning before birth, they manifest in the in-between state when they take on a form, and upon death they become un-manifest again.",
  "commentary": "She manifests from the un-manifest and becomes visible. She manifests so that the spiritual aspirant (sadhaka) has a concrete shape/form upon which he can contemplate and focus during his dhyana.\n\nA being before its birth is in an un-manifest state. Birth in this world is manifestation, that too for a brief period (vyakta मध्या) (madhyā)) lasting up to the point of death. Thereafter the being once again goes back to the un-manifest state. Bhagavad Gita in its second chapter states-\n\nअव्यक्तादिनि भुतानि व्यक्त-मध्यानि भारत,अव्यक्त-निधनान्य् एव तत्र का परिदेवना (Avyaktādini bhutāni vyakta-madhyāni bhārata,avyakta-nidhanāny eva tatra kā paridevanā)"
