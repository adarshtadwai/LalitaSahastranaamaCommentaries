  "meaning": "She cannot be measured. She cannot be bound.",
  "commentary": "(While reciting, there should be no pause between Uddhāma and वैभवा (vaibhavā) as it is one name).\n\nDāma refers to a rope. In the ancient past, the rope was used as a unit of measurement. Once Yadhoda māta tried to tie little Krishna, who was being very mischievous, to the urn with a rope (dāma) around His waist (udara). However hard she tried, the rope would always fall slightly short. Through this incident the Lord showed that the supreme energy is beyond measurement by any unit and hence Krishna was given the name Dāmodarā. He is Uddhāma- वैभवा। (vaibhavā.)"
