  "meaning": "She is beyond danger/risk (apāyā). She is indestructible.",
  "commentary": "After reaching Her, there can be no more dangers. Divine mother will pull the aspirant out of dangers involved during the process of Sadhana.\n\nUpāya refers to planning and direction while apāya refers to the danger. It is said that for every plan (upaya) the risks involved (apaya) should be calculated and only then the task should be initiated. However this rule does not apply to spiritual purposes as it is free from dangers.\n\nIn the chapter 6 of Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says- na hi कल्यन-कृत् (kalyana-kṛt) kascid durgatim tāta gacchati which means, ‘One who performs good deeds is never troubled by evil’.\n\nEven trivial efforts put in towards spiritual practices as well as the least service rendered to others does not go for a waste."
