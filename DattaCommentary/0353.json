  "name_transliterated": "Bhaktimat-kalpa-latikā",
  "meaning": "She fulfils every desire of Her devotee (bhakta).",
  "commentary": "Kalpalata is a creeper (lata) that grants everything that is desired. To those ardent devotees of hers, She is a wish-fulfilling creeper who fulfills every kind of wish.\n\nThis name can be interpreted as Bhaktimatkalpa +latika. It then means that She appears like an ordinary creeper (latika) to those who feign devotion. She showers her grace even upon such persons so as to gradually shift them on to the true path of devotion. Such is Her compassion. To them She is not a kalpalatika but an ordinary latika. While a kalpalatika is capable of fulfilling every kind of desire, an ordinary latika (creeper) will grant only one kind of fruit. Here the fruit will be proportionally based on what is deserved.\n\nTo develop complete unflinching faith and devotion towards the Supreme Mother, it many require few births. Yet, all through the Supreme Mother stands by us as a creeper (latika), blessing us and encouraging us to move on. Creating in us unflinching devotion is the best boon that She can grant."
