  "name_transliterated": "Chāru-candra-kalādharā",
  "meaning": "She retains the 16th phase (कला) ((kalā)) of the moon on Her forehead.",
  "commentary": "Due to association with the Divine Mother, the moon’s brightness just increases multi fold. She transfers Her energy into the moon so that it can benefit earth and the life on it. This 16th phase that is retained on Her forehead shines gently dispelling just that much light as needed. It is rightly proportioned- neither too large and bright nor too small and dark."
