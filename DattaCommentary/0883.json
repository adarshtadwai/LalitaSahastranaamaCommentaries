  "name_transliterated": "Yajamāna-svarūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "She is seated in her position of yajamāna (the person performing the yagna).",
  "commentary": "Yagna needs a yajamāna (doer) for its completion. Thus, in the person who is the karta (doer) of the homa/ yagna one should see the Divine Mother. For example, our Sadguru seats himself in the position of the yajamāna and performs the Srichakra archana on behalf of all devotees. The devotee should understand this and see the Divine Mother in the Sadguru. When Swamiji offers the flowers, the devotee should feel that he himself is making the offering through the hands of the Sadguru."
