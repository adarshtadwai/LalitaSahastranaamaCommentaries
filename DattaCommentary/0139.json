  "name_devanagari": "निर्गुणा",
  "name_transliterated": "Nirguṇā",
  "meaning": "All our karmas (actions) arise out of our traits (gunas). One should rise above these gunas. Engage in niśkāma karma (actions that are not linked to any desire).",
  "commentary": "Gunas (traits) are of 3 types- Sattva (traits of purity), Rajas (traits of action/ passion) and Tamas (inertia/ ignorance). Every being can be classified as operating within one or more of these traits. Every thought and every desire that one has, owes its birth to one of these traits. These gunas are the chains that have firmly bound our feet. Undoubtedly of the three, Sattva is the best, nevertheless, even that needs to be given up. The Divine Mother is beyond these three traits (Gunāteeta).\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita states –\n\nTraigunya-viśaya veda nistrai-gunyo bhavārjuna"
