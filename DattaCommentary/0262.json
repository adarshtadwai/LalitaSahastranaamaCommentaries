  "commentary": "Yatra nānyat pashyati nānyat shrunoti nanyad-vijānāti sa bhūma\n\nIt means that in this state of तुर्या, (turyā,) also known as bhūma, the person perceives nothing, hears nothing and knows nothing else. The person is completely absorbed in dhyana.\n\nThe 27th verse of Soundarya Lahari explains this –\n\njapo jalpah shilpam sakalam-api mudra-virachanagatih pradakshhinya-kramanam ashanady-ahuti vidhihpranamah samveshah sukham akhilam atmarpana-drshasaparya paryayah tava bhavatu yan-me vilasitamMeaning – O Divine Mother! Please accept all my actions as worship through mudras. Let all the words I utter be your japam. Let my walk be considered your pradakshina (circumambulation). What ever I eat should be an offering to you (ahuti). My sleep is an obeisance to you. I am offering my entire luxuries (sukha, happiness) to you. I offer myself to you.\n\nOnce this state is mentally achieved, gradually and automatically all the bad actions will get wiped away and sat karmas will increase. All the avasthas (stages) would have been handed over to Her."
