  "name_transliterated": "Tāmbhūla-pūrita-mukhī",
  "meaning": "Due to the juice of the betel leaves, Her lips are red in colour.",
  "commentary": "Her power of attraction is symbolized by this name. Through this attraction She causes a spurt towards spiritual journey in the beings.\n\nOne should not be misled by the gross meaning of the name and believe that the Supreme Mother is habituated to eating betel leaves (paan).\n\nA similar description of the Divine Mother exists in Lalita Trishati-  Karpoora veeti sourabhya kallolitha kakup thataa."
