  "name_transliterated": "Śāntiḥ",
  "meaning": "Let there be peace in this universe, peace in all the planes above and below it.",
  "commentary": "Shānti is a state of equilibrium. Shānti (peace) is present in those who reason out using their intellect and those who sincerely attempt yogic practices. Peace cannot be purchased nor can be acquired externally. It is purely an internal state that grows with increase in spiritual practices.\n\nSays Vashishta in Vashishta samhita –\n\nNa mokŚho nabhasah प्र्ष्ह्ते (prṣhte) na paataale na bhootale,Moksho hi cheto vimalam samyag jnana vibodhitam."
