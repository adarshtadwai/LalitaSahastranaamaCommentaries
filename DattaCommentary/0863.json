  "meaning": "She is the continuous flow of intentions (taranga) behind this play (creation) of Shiva (kāma).",
  "commentary": "She is the energy of intent (Iccha shakti). Her power of intent/ desire has been described as continuous waves.\n\nLord Shiva is Kāma, Kāmesha or Kāmeshwara. He is the Lord of all the intentions (sankalpa). Intention is both at the microcosm (individual) and macrocosm (universal) level. For example- Unless a person has an intention to cook, food will not be prepared. No sadhana can be undertaken by the person unless he possesses the intent to do so. Merely receiving initiation (upadesha) from the Guru is of no use unless intent to put it into practice exists in the individual. All these are individual intentions.\n\nLord Shiva possesses a state of pure intent (shuddha sankalpa). She is the energy that causes intentions (sankalpa) to flow in Lord Shiva. Such a state of pure intention arises only in those who are totally pure in thought.\n\nKāma is classified into Mahākāma, Samsārakāma and Yogakāma. Mahākāma is the universal intent. Samsārakāma is the individual intent where the individual constantly entertains desires. Yogakāma is the desire of the yogis to constantly move up in the spiritual ladder. The Divine Mother possesses the Maha kāma.\n\nIn Lalita Sahasranama names Shiva- Shivā, Brahma- Brahmāni, Kāmeshwara- Kāmeshwari, Rājeshwarā- Rājeshwari, Eshwara- Eshwari, Vaishnava- Vaishnavi etc. refer to the same energy irrespective of whether it is described as masculine or feminine."
