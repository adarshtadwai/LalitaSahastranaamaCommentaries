  "meaning": "She is the ālāpāna in art (kaḷa) of music (ālāpāna is the melodious articulation of the notes by the singer through the usage of syllables).",
  "commentary": "With this we understand that She has a very melodious voice, She talks sweetly and that She is a form of nature (prakriti swaroopini).  Her ālāpānas contain spiritual lessons.  She is Mookāmbika- She removes the dumbness and dullness that exist within the beings. The Upanishads and the Vedas are Her musical renditions.\n\nFor this reason, during a music concert it is exceedingly important to listen to rāga ālāpana with rapt attention."
