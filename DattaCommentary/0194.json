  "meaning": "She shreds away durāchāra from among Her devotees.",
  "commentary": "Āchāra refers to customs, observances, practices and code of conduct that is adhered. Sadāchāra is the proper/rightful way of conduct, observances and customs that are passed down the generations. Its antonym is durāchāra.\n\nThe Divine Mother, with her infinite grace, drives away from Her devotee all durāchāras.In the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated –\n\nस्ह्रेयन् स्wअ-धर्मो विगुनः पर्-धर्मात् स्wअनुस्थितात्स्wअधर्म्ē निधनं श्रेयः पर-धर्म्ō भयावहः (Shreyan swa-dharmo vigunaḥ par-dharmāt swanusthitātSwadharmē nidhanaṃ śreyaḥ para-dharmō bhayāvahaḥ)\n\nEveryone has to mandatorily follow the dharma that has been laid down upon him/her by the ancestors even if it appears small and un-rewarding. To die doing one’s duty (dharma) is the best course. One should not try to do someone else’s dharma, because to do others jobs will not give the same fulfillment."
