  "commentary": "a) She is at a level higher than even the intellect. She is Parāparā.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita it is said – yo buddhe˙ paratas tu sa\n\nb) She is over and above Parā and Apara bhakti (devotion) and Para and Apara-vidya (knowledge).\n\nWhere a person possesses unsurpassed devotion towards the Supreme Lord, then this devotion is known as ‘Para bhakti’. This devotion progresses to a state when the person completely surrenders himself to the Almighty.  This devotion is termed Apara bhakti. Here the person sees no difference between himself and the Supreme Lord. Para bhakti paves the way to reach Apara bhakti.\n\nWith this the Mangala-chandi-vidya upasana, which began with the 750th name, concludes. We are now stepping into Kapardini-vidya-upasana."
