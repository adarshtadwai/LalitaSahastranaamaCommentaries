  "meaning": "She is the form of exquisite and ultimate bliss (ananda).",
  "commentary": "The 5 aspects of Paramatma are Asti, bhāti, priyam, roopa and nāma. Asti (eternal existence), bhāti (illumination, brightness), priyam (perpetually blissful) are eternal aspects of the Supreme, while the last two, i.e. name (nāma) and form (roopa) appear and disappear. Hence the first three aspects are most dear to Her.\n\nThese 3 names beginning from छन्द्र-मण्डल-मध्यगा (Chandra-maṇḍala-madhyagā) explain these constant aspects of the Supreme entity. ‘छन्द्र-मण्डल-मध्यगाऽ (‘Chandra-maṇḍala-madhyagā’) depicts Her eternal existence. ‘Chāru-rūpā’ glorifies Her Divine illumination. ‘Chāru-hāsā’ means She is eternally in bliss."
