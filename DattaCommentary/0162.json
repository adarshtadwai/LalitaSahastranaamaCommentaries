  "meaning": "How can delusion (moha) and grief (shoka) exist in one who sees the self everywhere?",
  "commentary": "In His composition Panchadaśī, Swamy Vidyaranya states –\n\nAtmāstanga statonyat indrajālam himāyikam iti achanchalam nischite.\n\nIśavyāsopaniśad declares –\n\nTatra ko mohah kah śoka ekatvamanupaśyatah.\n\nThe object behind these Vedic statements is not merely to understand and appreciate them, but to inspire the reader to put them into practice. Likewise, merely saluting a great Mahatma is inadequate; trying to adopt some of his principles that took him to the pinnacle is important.\n\nMoha has been explained as ‘dharma vimoodhatvam’, which means ‘going against the dictates of dharma’. Dharma should always be abided by. Many a time the question as to why a daily discipline should be adhered to springs up in the mind. Even such questioning emerges out of moha."
