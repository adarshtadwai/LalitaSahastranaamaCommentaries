  "commentary": "As it is the fire-god who eternally protects us, it is to be understood that She is Agni (fire). She exists in the form of fire sacrifices (yagnas and homas).\n\nAgni is one amongst the three visible Gods in this creation (pratyaksha daivam) and is also the medium that connects the humans to deities (Devatas). Like a postman the fire-god carries our offerings to the concerned deities and thus makes us eligible to receive their blessings. He is thus our protector. He is titled Hayavāt.Havyavāhana suggests that He is a medium.\n\nThe Supreme Lord created yagnas (sacrifices) at the start of creation. He sought that the beings should evolve to higher levels through the medium of the yagnas. The philosophy of life can be summed up through one-word ‘yagna’. This word assumes great significance in Bhagavad Gita. Every moment of the life is to be dedicated to the performance of sacrifice (yagna) that is aimed at higher fulfillment. Fire sacrifices (homams) are a part of this yagna. In a homa, mantras and Agni (fire) play the most critical role. In return, the fire god blesses us with the ‘homa raksha’ i.e. the bhasma (holy ash). This bhasma is sacred as it has been energized by the recitation of various holy mantras. It is the blessing and protection (raksha) sent back to us by the deity who was invoked through the process of homa.\n\nIn ancient days, the practice of offering cooked food to Agni (fire God) was prevalent. The lady of the house would offer the first morsel of the cooked food to the burning fire."
