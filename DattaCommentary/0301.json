  "meaning": "The seed letter (beejākshara) Hreem is both Her name and form.",
  "commentary": "The seed letter ‘Hreem’ is very dear to Her for it conjoins both Hari and Hara (Vishnu and Shiva). It is said that all the various seed letters in existence are encompassed in the letter Hreem. This is a very powerful seed letter. In the hymn ‘Lalita Trishati’, Hreem is extolled. She is addressed as ‘ॐ (‘Om) Hreem namaha’. Tripura Rahasya composed by Lord Parasurama is based purely on the seed letter Hreem.\n\nThe 15 sylabled (panchadaśee) mantra has in it 3 divisions (refer the 85th nama Srimad Vagbhava kutaika). Hreem is the seed letter that conjoins the different portions of this mantra. This seed letter Hreem connects the individual (jeevatma) to the Supreme (Eshwara).\n\nWhen Hreem is said deeply and with full force, it shakes up the body. As the result all deep hidden diseases also get wiped out."
