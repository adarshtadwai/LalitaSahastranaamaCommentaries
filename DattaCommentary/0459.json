  "commentary": "Such divine infinite radiance is clearly visible in an emerald idol (Marakata vigraha). Marakata is a divine stone whose radiance increases with age and with abhisheka. Emerald is a stone that is closely associated with Guru. Mara refers to ‘diseases’ and kata means ‘to cut’. It is a divine stone that dispels diseases. Deities carved out of this stone are very precious/ sacred."
