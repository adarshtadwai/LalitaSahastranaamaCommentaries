  "name_devanagari": "तत्पदलक्ष्यार्था",
  "name_transliterated": "Tatpada-lakṣyārthā",
  "meaning": "The infinite essence, the divinity, which pervades the entire universe and is present in everything- living, movable, as well as non- living and immovable object is ‘tat’. It is the Supreme Mother. Such knowledge, realization and experience happen purely due to the grace of the Guru. I reverentially offer my salutations to such a Guru.",
  "commentary": "Tat means that. In this world whatever we point out to as ‘that’, is Her manifestation. In other words, every external object or being that we see in this visible world is Her form. She can be realized through the understanding of this great truth.\n\nWhy is it being referred as ‘tat’ instead of ‘He’ or ‘She’? This is because the supreme essence is neither male nor female hence it is ‘tat’.\n\nअखन्द-मन्दलाकरम् व्याप्तम् येन छराछरम्।तत्पदम् दर्शितम् येन तस्मै श्रि गुरवे नमह्। (Akhanda-mandalākaram vyāptam yena charācharam.Tatpadam darśitam yena tasmai śri Gurave namah.)"
