  "name_devanagari": "तत्",
  "name_transliterated": "Tat",
  "meaning": "That which has no second (atma, Paramatma) and that which is alone and eternal (sat); that which has no name and form; that which remains the same at all times (changeless both before and after creation) is ‘tat’. This is the atma. This is God.",
  "commentary": "Understanding Paramatma is the toughest subject and hence the Supreme essence has been defined as ‘that’ (tat) i.e. as an object. This is the first level of understanding. The Vedic statement ‘Tasmai namah’ means ‘Obeisance to that separate entity (‘tat’).\n\n‘Tat’ is something that cannot be imagined as it is beyond space and time. He who is the power behind the individual existence, He who fills our intellect with Jnana, who gives the power of thinking on to the individual, is ‘tat’. The following verse explains ‘tat’-\n\nEkam eva adviteeyam sat naama roopa vivarjitamSrushtehe pura adhunaabhsyaa tatrutvam taditeeryate."
