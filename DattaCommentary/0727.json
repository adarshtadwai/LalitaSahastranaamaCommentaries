  "name_transliterated": "Śiva-jñāna-pradāyinī",
  "meaning": "She bestows the knowledge of Shiva on to Her devotees.",
  "commentary": "‘Shiva Jnana’ means ‘pure knowledge’. When worshipped as Dakshināmurty, She grants this knowledge.\n\nWith this the initiation into Saraswati vidya, which began with nama 701, is complete. Dakshināmurty is a form of knowledge and hence acquiring the knowledge of Shiva concludes this upasana.\n\nThe namas 728 (चित्-कला) ((Cit-kalā)) to Mrtyu daara Kutharika teach ‘Nandi vidya’. Nandi is the primary deity for Mrudamgam and laya (merger, absorption). Absorption (laya) concerns the mind."
