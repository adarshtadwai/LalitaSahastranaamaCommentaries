  "meaning": "Deekshita is She who has taken an uncompromising vow or a solemn promise. Protection of Her devotees is Her main vow.",
  "commentary": "Those who undertake and accomplish tough yagnas are generally conferred with the title ‘Deekshita’ Or ‘Deekshit’. When a person takes on a deeksha, for example Datta Deeksha, he/ she promises to abide by the prescribed rules and regulations relating to that practice. Fasting, sleeping on a mat during that period all symbolize adherence to that vow. Students should take vidya deeksha; a promise that during their entire period of studies their mind will not deviate towards matters other than their studies.\n\nAs a composite form of all the yagnas She is Deekshita."
