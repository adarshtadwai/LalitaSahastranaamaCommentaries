  "name_transliterated": "Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-tapta-jana-viśrānti-dāyinī",
  "meaning": "She washes away the suffering/ afflictions of birth (janma), death (mrtyu) and old age (जरा) ((jarā)) and thus provides rest/relief to her devotees.",
  "commentary": "(This is one name and hence pausing after ‘tapta’ is wrong. Pausing in between during recitation alters the meaning).\n\nBirth (janma), जरा (jarā) (old age) and death (mrtyu) are the 3 tāpatrayās (tapta) that afflict the beings and cause them terrible distress. By alleviating them, She provides happiness (sukha) and rest to her devotees."
