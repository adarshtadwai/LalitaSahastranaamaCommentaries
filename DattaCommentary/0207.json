  "name_devanagari": "मनोन्मनी",
  "name_transliterated": "Manonmanī",
  "meaning": "It is She who resides during the state that arises when the mind is absolutely controlled (mano nigraha).This is a very important name and is deeply connected to yoga.",
  "commentary": "Manonmani is comprised of two words, mana + unmani. Unmani means ‘crossed over’. Manonmani thus refers to a state in which the aspirant has ‘crossed over the limitations of the mind’. It is the state that comes after the senses (indriyas) have been completely subdued, the mind rendered thoughtless and when it is completely immersed in dhyana.\n\nYoga should be undertaken purely to achieve ‘chitta vritti nirodah’ (cessation of all mental transformations). The mind that is habituated to run every second is gradually trained to reduce thought waves. The sacred text ‘Yoga tarāvali’ composed by Sri Shankara Bhagavad pādacharya elaborates in great detail about this Manonmani state."
