  "number": 700,
  "name_devanagari": "सच्चिदानन्दरूपिणी",
  "name_transliterated": "Saccidānanda-rūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "She is the form of Sacchidānanda.",
  "commentary": "Sacchidānanda refers to the 3 aspects of Parabrahma i.e. sat, chit and ananda. Sat stands for the truth that is eternal; Chit is Jnana (supreme knowledge) or consciousness; Ananda is the state of eternal, supreme bliss.\n\nShe blesses those who undertake Savitri upasana with this state of Sacchidānanda. They can visualize her in this form.\n\nWith this the 7th avarana is complete and the journey into the 8th avarana begins. The names 701 (देश-काला-परिच्छिन्ना) ((Deśa-kālā-paricchinnā)) to 727 (Śiva-jñāna-pradāyinī) initiate us into the Saraswati vidya."
