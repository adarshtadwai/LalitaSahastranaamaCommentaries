  "meaning": "She dispels all grief and fears (dukha).",
  "commentary": "All the sorrows are classified under the 3 tāpatrayas (the 3 tāpas). Due to sorrows and afflictions the body gets tensed and heated (tāpa). The 3 tāpas are – ādhyātmika, ādhibhoutika and ādhi daivika.\n\nĀdhyātmika tāpatrayās refers to bodily afflictions. Here the ādhyātmika should not be confused for troubles related to spiritual pursuits.\n\nĀdhibhoutika tāpatrayās refers to afflictions caused by external elements like fever, snake bite etc. Afflictions due to unforeseen calamities are ādhi-daivika tāpatrayas for example afflictions due to rain, storm.\n\nShe relieves Her devotees from all these 3 types of afflictions."
