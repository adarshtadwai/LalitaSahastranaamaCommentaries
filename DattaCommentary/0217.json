  "name_devanagari": "महाशक्तिः",
  "name_transliterated": "Mahā-śaktiḥ",
  "meaning": "Only when Shiva is coupled with energy (shakti), He can create. In its absence, He cannot budge even an inch.",
  "commentary": "This energy is the root behind all this creation.\n\nAdi Shankaracharya’s ‘Soundarya Lahiri’ begins with a reference to this shakti (energy) –\n\nशिवह् शक्त्या युक्तो यदि भवति शक्तह् प्रभवितुं (śivah śaktyā yukto yadi bhavati śaktah prabhavituṃ)\n\nThe speciality of this energy lies in it being abundant, vast, unending and encompassing the entire creation. This is an indestructible energy. Every good thought, every good action and every good intention to walk in the right path originates out of this energy.\n\nUpanishads collectively declare that Mahā-śaktih is that which fills knowledge (Jnana) and the illumination (chaitanya) within the beings. This name has the same meaning as Mahāmayā."
