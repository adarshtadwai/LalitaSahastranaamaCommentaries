  "meaning": "Varadā, Shrīhī, Shadā and Saraswati are Her 4 names. She resides within the Mooladharā Chakra in all these forms.",
  "commentary": "At Mooladhāra She is extolled as Saraswati. This is because the being needs to root out the immobility and stiffness (jadatvam) that exists within him/her and decide to move upwards on the spiritual journey. Developing this desire is the first step in this journey. Even to develop such a desire exclusive grace of Goddess Saraswati is essential. Hence at the very first point in the spiritual journey (Mooladhaara Chakra) She is worshipped.\n\nMaharishi Agastya in his hymn praises Saraswati as-\n\nYā kundendu tushāra हार-धवला, (hāra-dhavalā,) या (yā) shubhra-vastra’avritāYā veena-vara-danda-manditakara, या (yā) shweta padma’asanaYā brahma’achyuta shankara prabhritibhir देवै-सदा (devai-sadā) vanditāSā mām pātu Saraswati bhagavatee nihshesha जाद्यऽअपहा (jādya’apahā) -1Dorbhiryukta chaturbhim sphatikamaninibhai akshamālandadhanaHastenaikena padmam sitamapicha shukam pustakam chaparena |Bhāsa kundendushankhasphatikamaninibha bhasamana.asamanaSa me vagdevateyam nivasatu vadane sarvada suprasanna -2\n\nThis is a very sacred hymn. In addition to Saraswati, Hayagreeva swamy, Dattatreya and Ganapati bless the person with knowledge."
