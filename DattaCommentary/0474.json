  "number": 474,
  "name_devanagari": "यशस्विनी",
  "name_transliterated": "Yaśasvinī",
  "meaning": "She is very famous. The Supreme Mother is known as Yashaswini in Sahasrara chakra.",
  "commentary": "Da, Ra, La, Ka, Sā, Ha and Ya are the 7 seed letters and the names of the presiding deity at the various Chakras, referred to in the 7 preceding names.\n\nThe next 62 names refer exclusively to the details about the six spiritual centers within the body (shat chakras). The number 62 is associated with the Divine Yoginis Mothers (Yogini māta), who are the assistants of the Divine Mother.\n\nEven at the time of the consecration of the idol within the temple, the Yogini mātas are invoked through the installation of the yogini mandala. The invocation of the deities connected to the vastu and Navagraha (planets) are also undertaken. These are done so that the persons visiting the temple and visualizing the idol also enjoy their blessings and thereby progress on the spiritual (yogic) path and attain salvation.\n\nThe description of the Chakras in this Sahasranama begins from the Vishuddha chakra located near the throat instead of the traditional approach of beginning from the Mooladhaara chakra located at the bottom of the spine. This is because Vishuddha is the primary point of contact for the air being inhaled by the person. The air touches the Vishuddha chakra and then travels down to the other Chakras. Vishuddha is also the hub for various nādis (astral subtle nerves) of the body, which converge at this point.\n\nThe namas 475 to 484 describe Goddess Dākini, who resides in Vishuddha Chakra."
