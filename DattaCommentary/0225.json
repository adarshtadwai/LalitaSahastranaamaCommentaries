  "commentary": "Meanin – She is the empress (Eshwari) who controls and rules the superior-most yogas; it can also be said that She is the empress who rules all the greatest yogis (ascetics and saints).\n\nOnly after crossing the stage of Mahā-siddhi a person can advance into Mahā-yoga state.\n\nIn the last verse of Bhagavad Gita, it is stated- Yatra yogeshwarah krishno yatra partho dhanurdharah. Here Sri Krishna is referred to as the Lord of Yoga (yogeśwara).\n\nKrishna was a complete incarnation (poorna avatara). His teachings are known as Bhagavad Gita – the song of the Almighty. To depict that the Supreme Mother herself has incarnated in this form, Krishna stands in the feminine form of tribhangi (Tribhangi consists of three bends in the body – at the neck, waist and knee, hence the body is oppositely curved at waist and neck which gives it a gentle “S” shape). Moreover, the seed letters (beejaksharas) used for the worship of Krishna and the Supreme Mother are one and the same."
