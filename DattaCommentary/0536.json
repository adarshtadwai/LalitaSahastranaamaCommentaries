  "name_transliterated": "Swadhā",
  "meaning": "The Divine Mother has manifested as Swadhā in order to pass on the oblations to the forefathers.",
  "commentary": "Tarpana means ‘the offering that satisfies’. It thus refers to the offerings made by the person to his departed forefathers in the manner prescribed by the scriptures. During the death ceremony when offering is made into the fire the word Swadhā is uttered. As Swadhā is the medium through which the Fire God carries the offerings, She is said to be his wife.\n\nSwadhā Devi has other names such as Pitruprāna तुल्या, (tulyā,) Dvijajeevanaroopini, Shrādhādhistādri, Shraadhāphala प्रदा, (pradā,) Brahma mānasa कन्या, (kanyā,) Pitru tushi प्रदा (pradā) and dvijapreeti करा।एवेर्य् (karā.Every) being born in this earth is indebted to his parents who have taken the trouble of bringing him/her to earth. Hence at least once a year the departed parents should be remembered and offerings should be made to them. This is the dharma of every individual and there is no escape from it."
