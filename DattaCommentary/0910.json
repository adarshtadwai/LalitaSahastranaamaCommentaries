  "commentary": "Soma is Sa+Uma. Shiva takes on this name ‘Soma’ to stress upon His association with the Divine Mother. She playfully takes on His name again and is known as Soumya- the energy of Soma. This highlights that there is no difference between the energies of Shiva and Shakti.Meaningof Soumya-  She has a gentle nature that is as cooling as the Moon.\n\nSoma is another name for the Moon. Devi retains the moon on Her crescent. The coolness showered by the Moon teaches that one should create calm, cool and peaceful environment around him/her. When a true yogi enters any premises, it is rendered calm and peaceful."
