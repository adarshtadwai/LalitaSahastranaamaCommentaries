  "meaning": "She is resplendently shining with Her yellow coloured clothes.",
  "commentary": "Krishna always wears yellow clothes (Peetambhara dhaari).\n\nPibati manaha iti peetam- means ‘yellow (peeta) colour drinks up (pibati) the mind (manasa)’. Yellow colour attracts the mind and thereafter swallows it up. The Lord attracts us and extracts out of us our desires, attractions and finally our mind. Lord Krishna ploughs our mind (krishati) and thereby purifies it. Seated at this chakra, the Divine Mother with Her yellow clothes attracts our mind."
