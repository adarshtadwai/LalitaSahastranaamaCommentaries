  "commentary": "a) She is Bhagawati, the presiding deity of the Chotanikkara temple at Kerala.\n\nMalaya refers to the land of Kerala. The forests here are abundant in sandal wood trees. Sandal paste that is dear to Her is found in plenty here.\n\nb) She resides as good intellect (achala) amongst Her dearest devotees.\n\nEven amongst her many children, a mother tends to have a soft corner towards some of them due to their inherent qualities, helpful tendencies and the like. Likewise, the Divine Mother, from amongst her millions of children, has a soft corner towards those who undertake good deeds and are on the path of truth. She is the good intellect (achala) in such persons. Such persons can be compared to sandal paste. To them She appears as Bhagawati."
