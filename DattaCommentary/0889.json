  "name_transliterated": "Viśva-bhramaṇa-kāriṇī",
  "meaning": "She puts the world under Her spell of illusion (maya, brama). She causes the rotation of the worldly cycle (vishwa Yantra).",
  "commentary": "Mere endless chanting of the Vedas is insufficient; the ego (pride) that arises because of this ability should be given up. The idea of superiority over the masses should be erased. Equality should be practiced. In its absence, the person will get completely encircled in the net of illusion spun by the Divine Mother.\n\nThe original being, the atma, inherently has no feelings of I and mine. Nevertheless, the same being, when it enters a human body develops the feelings of individuality. Desires, feelings of comforts, me, mine, feelings of superiority and greatness rule the human mind. All these are outcomes of the feeling of individuality (ahamkara). This ahamkara puts the being under a spell. It is said that She causes such spell."
