Bali means Puja.\n\nkushmāndam ikshudamdam cha sreephalam nārikelakam yete bali samaaproktah.\n\nKushmanda (white pumpkin) and ikshu danda (sugarcane) are offered to Devi as Bali during Puja. During Chandi homa, the white pumpkin is cut as an offering to the Divine Mother. Later this is fed to the cows."
