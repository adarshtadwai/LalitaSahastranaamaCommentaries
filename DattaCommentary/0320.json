  "name_transliterated": "Ramaṇa-lampaṭā",
  "meaning": "She diligently follows Lord Ramana and is always by His side.",
  "commentary": "Ramana refers to Lord Venkata-ramana (Venkateshwara).\n\n‘Lam’ is the seed letter for earth element (bhumi tattva). We understand this from the verse- ‘lam’ prithvi tatvātmikayai गन्धं (gandhaṃ) parikalpāyami. ‘पटऽ (‘Paṭa’) stands for ignorance/ illusion (maya). ‘Lampata’ thus refers to the force that has covered this entire earth with maya (ignorance). This is Her position as Brahma. It also emphasizes that She blesses Her devotee with the associated joy."
