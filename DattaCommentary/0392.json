  "meaning": "She is the left half of Shreekanta’s body. (Sreekanta is Shiva). This is the Ardha-naareshwara form of the divine wherein the right half of the body is that of Shiva’s and the left half is Hers.",
  "commentary": "At one point of time, Lord Shiva gulped down the poison in order to save the world. The term ‘Shri’ stands for both nectar and poison. Kanta is the neck/throat. As this Lord gulped down the poison He is Shreekanta. This Lord resides in Nanjangud, near Mysore. Nanja means poison. As She is the left half of the Lord’s body, the poison also went down Her throat. This shows the oneness between them.\n\nOur Upanishads authentically state that prior to creation only Paramatma existed. This atma divided into 2 and threw itself into the world. One was the male form and another female; the husband and the wife. The atma that was inherently devoid of traits (nirguna) and form, now took on a form. The splitting of one atma (Paramatma) into two is depicted as ardha-naareeshwara roopa (half male- half female form).\n\nPrabha means effulgence, light or brightness. This aspect of effulgence is a trait of the Sun and hence this knowledge is known as Savitri Vidya (knowledge relating to the Sun). Savita also means Supreme Knowledge. Light (knowledge) dispels darkness (ignorance).\n\nJust as there is a visible Sun, there exists within our heart a Sun that is guiding us with its light and effulgence. We should understand that both the Suns are one and the same."
