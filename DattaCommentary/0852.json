  "name_devanagari": "सर्वोपनिषदुद्घुष्टा",
  "name_transliterated": "Sarvopaniṣadudguṣṭā",
  "meaning": "All the Upanishads proclaim or speak about Her only. They sing Her glories.",
  "commentary": "Upanishad can be split as- Upa+ni+shad. ‘Upa’ means ‘close by’; ‘nee’ means ‘neechai or a little lower seat’ and ‘shad’ is ‘to sit’. Upanishad thus means ‘to sit close by in a lower seat’. Sitting in a seat lower than that of Guru or God indicates the devotion and dedication of a student who seeks to learn. What is it that the student seeks to learn? Upanishads contain the various truths about the self and teach about the self. They show the path to reach divinity. They contain the essence of the Vedas. They provide relief from the afflictions of birth, old age and death."
