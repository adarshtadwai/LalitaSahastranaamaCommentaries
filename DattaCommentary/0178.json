  "name_transliterated": "Nirbhedā",
  "meaning": "She destroys such feelings of differentiation (dualism) that exist within her devotees.",
  "commentary": "Let us understand this better.\n\nAmong the names most frequently used to address the Divine Mother are Shakti, Adishakti and Parashakti. Shakti (energy) is of varied types- life energy (Prana shakti), energy of knowledge (vidya shakti), the energy of creation (sristi shakti), mental energy (manas shakti), energy of destruction (pralaya shakti), energy that sustains (sthithi shakti) and so on.\n\nEach and every good trait that exists within us is a shakti (energy) that has been especially bestowed upon us by the Lord.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the person passing on the energy, the person receiving the energy and the energy itself are considered as 3 different entities. In the case of the Divine Mother, She is the energy, She is passing the energy and She is receiving the energy. As no differentiations exist, She is Nirbheda. As this relates to Srividya, let us understand the following verse –\n\nśakti śaktimatōr भेदं (bhedaṃ) vadantya paramārtatahabhedyam chānu paśyanti yoginas tattva darśinah ǁ\n\nNirbheda (non-dualism) is one of the most important teachings. All our scriptures and Upanishads preach this essence. This is a very important lesson for merging into the infinite.\n\nDifferentiation (bheda) exists at various levels. We believe that we are a separate entity from others. We believe that we are separate from God and the like. Due to these beliefs, we imagine that we are superior to others. All these differentiations need to be overcome. Overcoming this itself is a significant milestone in the path of Yoga. Achieving this takes us to the state of Nir-bheda. The Supreme Mother, with Her compassion, blesses us with this achievement."
