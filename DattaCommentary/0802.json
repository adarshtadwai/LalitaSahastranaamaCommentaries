  "name_devanagari": "पुरातना",
  "name_transliterated": "Purātanā",
  "meaning": "She is very ancient (eternal).",
  "commentary": "Truth and knowledge are both eternal. There is nothing that can be newly added to it. Every invention brings back to the world the knowledge that exists invisibly. For example, description of Pushpaka-vimana in Ramayana teaches us that aeroplanes existed in ancient times. Demon Ravana possessed this plane.\n\nAs the name suggests, ‘research’ is nothing but ‘re-search’ i.e. searching once again for that which was originally known/ existed. Such re-search should be directed towards re-learning about the self (self realization)."
