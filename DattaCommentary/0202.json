  "name_transliterated": "Sarveśvarī",
  "meaning": "It is Lord Iśa who pervades this entire universe. He is the sole independent entity. He pervades everything that is contained within this universe. Every object that we utilize in this world belongs to the Supreme Lord Isha. Use all the wealth in your position of a trustee and then hand it over to others when your time comes.",
  "commentary": "The first stanza of the Ishavasya Upanishad declares –\n\nIśavāsyam idam सर्वं (sarvaṃ) yat kim ca jagatyam jagat,tena tyaktēna भुन्जिथा, (bhunjithā,) ma grudhah kasyasvid dhanam\n\nTrishati contains a name ‘Sarveshi’ which reflects the same essence."
