  "commentary": "This nama has 2 meanings –\n\na) She possesses utmost strength (बला) ((balā)) and fills our body with the required strength.b) She blesses even animals and birds with liberation.\n\nBalā also means crow. The story of Kakabhushunda appears in Yoga Vashishta. Kakabhushunda was a crow. He came from a family of 21 siblings. Among them were some swans and some crows. All of them together conducted the Brāhmi upasana. Those crows and cocks that crow during the Brahmi muhurtam are said to be conducting the Brāhmi upasana.This Brāhmi muhurtam is Saraswati muhurtam. (Muhurtam means ‘auspicious time’). Those who study at that time are blessed with good memory and intellect. It is mandatory for all students to be awake by that time. Saraswati, the energy of Brahma, will be moving about at that time.\n\nTo the crow, crowing is the mantra. Due to the relentless Brahmi muhurta upasana, gradually kakabhushunda was blessed with liberation. This summarises that all animals and birds also are blessed by her with liberation."
