  "name_transliterated": "Roga-parvata-dhambholiḥ",
  "meaning": "She is the Vajrāyudhā (diamond weapon of Lord Indra) that can shred diseases of the body and mind which are as huge as mountains.",
  "commentary": "Vedas state that in the beginning of creation mountains had wings and hence could fly. At that time, Lord Indra took his Vajrāyudhā and chopped the wings of the mountains. This is no fantasy story. A deep significance is hidden within it.\n\nThe Lord created the earth and it was slowly formed as a combination of various elements from various directions. After a certain point the Supreme force decided to stop this exercise. Nevertheless, the atoms still continued to get attracted to and fall on the earth. These are referred to as the flying mountains. These were potentially dangerous to the life on earth. If huge stones and pebbles from outer space get attracted to the earth and keep hitting it with force, then what about the life on earth? Hence the Supreme Lord, in his form as Indra, used his power of attraction to attract them towards himself and thus prevented them from landing on earth. Simultaneously he increased the gravity of Mother Earth."
