  "commentary": "This is the most prominent trait of Parabrahma.\n\n‘Vikalpa’ means ‘change of state’. The Supreme Lord, Parabrahma, under no circumstances, deviates from his inherent state and hence is Nirvikalpa.\n\nLet us delve a little deeper into the meaning.\n\nShabda anupāti vikalpah– refers to the changes that take place in the mind based on the sounds heard even though the sound is inherently meaningless.\n\nCertain sounds create in us a kind of fear, agitation, confusion or disturbance. For example, sudden thunder causes fear. Likewise, certain sounds create excessive joy. Certain words are meaningless; even then they cause a change in the mental plane. Let us consider the word ‘Shasha vishānaha’ which means ‘hare’s horn’. Even though it is absurd, it causes an imagination (vikalpa) in the mind. There are also certain meaningless sounds that are created from within us and which are capable of causing changes to the mind. These agitations, fears and joy, imagination, disturbance etc. reflect the changes that take place on a mental plane and are vikalpa. All these subjects have a deep connection to yoga.\n\nAll these changes (vikalpa) disturb the mind and hamper spiritual growth. The aspirant should reach a stage wherein even if the word is audible, he should not be able to hear it. This includes unnecessary sounds such as traffic sounds, TV sounds etc. This is the Nirvikalpa state. Have we not heard of Nirvikalpa Samadhi?\n\nSupreme Mother is over and above all these vikalpas and hence is nir-vikalpa."
