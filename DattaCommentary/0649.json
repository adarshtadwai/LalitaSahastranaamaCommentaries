  "commentary": "She can be seen only with the yogic eye. Dhyana and yoga are the only means to have Her vision.\n\nVedas declare – Yad drshyam tan nashyam\n\nEverything has to get absorbed one day into that infinite.  Such a state is called Pralaya. Pralaya is not destruction but absorption; going back to the state from which it originated. At this point, the Lord is moving from the waking (jaagrat) state to Tureeya state (4th stage)."
