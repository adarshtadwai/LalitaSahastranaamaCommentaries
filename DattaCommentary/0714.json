  "number": 714,
  "name_devanagari": "कुलोत्तीर्णा",
  "name_transliterated": "Kulottīrṇā",
  "meaning": "She is over and above the Chakras (spiritual centers known as kula).",
  "commentary": "We have discussed in the earlier names that Her primary residence is the Mūladhāra chakra (also known as kula). From here, She travels up to the Sahasrāra and thereafter returns back to the kula (mūladhāra). The truth however is that She is over and above all the Chakras.\n\nUttīrna means ‘to cross over’. She helps Her devotee cross over the 6 Chakras and takes him to Sahasrāra. कुलोत्तीर्णा (Kulottīrṇā) also means that She helps the devotee cross over the limitations of this cycle of births and deaths and rewards him/her with liberation."
