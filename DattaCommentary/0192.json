  "meaning": "She bestows happiness and bliss (sukha) upon Her devotee. This includes both ordinary happiness as well as spiritual bliss.",
  "commentary": "It is not sufficient to relieve the devotee of his afflictions; granting him both happiness and bliss is more important. Worldly happiness is temporal; securing the divine happiness (bliss, ananda) is the real blessing.\n\nUpanishads explain in detail about the different levels of bliss enjoyed by a being at various stages of evolution. This composition is called ‘Anandavalli’ of the Taittareeya Upanishad. In it is said that there are 11 types of bliss. Each type of bliss is merely 1/100th of the bliss enjoyed at the next level of progression. The human being who is at the bottom of the chain enjoys 1/100th of the bliss enjoyed by the Manushya-Gandharva (type of celestial being), who is at the immediate next level. The Manushya-Gandharva in turn enjoys 1/100th of the bliss that is enjoyed by the Deva-Gandharva, who is one level above him. In this manner, it elaborates the entire chain starting from the human being and ending with the bliss enjoyed by Brahma (Brahmānanda). In the middle of this chain is the bliss enjoyed by Gandharvas, Devas, Indra, Prajapati and others. Anandavalli also declares that engaging in Nishkāma karma (selfless/ desireless action), is the key to achieve this bliss."
