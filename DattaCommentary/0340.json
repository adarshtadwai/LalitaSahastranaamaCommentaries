  "commentary": "This illusion (Vishnu māyā) is Her creation for Her amusement. She playfully laughs at all those who try to cross over this illusion without surrendering to Her and seeking Her help, for, it is a futile attempt.\n\n2) She is the total illumination (Chaitanya).\n\nChaitanya (prakasha) is known as Vilāsini. Brightness/ illumination is that which drives out darkness.\n\n3) Vilāsini also conveys that She is a treasure house of Supreme Knowledge.\n\nAn aspirant can reach the state of ‘Vilāsini’ only after crossing over the ‘Vishnu māyā’. Vishnu māyā (339th name) can be overcome if and only when it is understood from deep within that She Herself is ‘Veda Janani’ (the mother of the Vedas; 338th name)!\n\nOnly He who is able to understand that She is ‘Vidhātri’ (Lord Brahma) (337th name) can realize that She has created the Vedas. To understand this, the ego should be completely routed out in the person. When ego is routed out, Her form as ‘Veda vedya’ (335th name) is visualized. The aspirant is then able to visualize Her as Vishwadhika (334th name).\n\nAll these names are the foundations for the Jnana khanda (branch of knowledge) of Lalita Sahasranama that is about to be taught. Up to now the explanations were about the path of devotion (bhakti). Devotion and knowledge (Jnana) are inter-twined."
