  "name_devanagari": "श्रीशिवा",
  "name_transliterated": "Sri-shivā",
  "meaning": "Just as wind and its motion (spandana) are the same; just as fire and its heat are identical, even so, the Supreme Consciousness and His energy are identical. Such an attitude should be developed.",
  "commentary": "Shiva and his energy (shakti) are inseparable. For our easy understanding, his energy has been depicted as a separate female form with a separate identity.\n\nयथैकं पवन-स्पन्दम् एकम् औष्ण्यानलौयथाचिन्-मात्रं स्पन्द-शक्तिश् च तथैवैकात्म सर्वदा (yathaikaṃ pavana-spandam ekam auṣṇyānalauyathācin-mātraṃ spanda-śaktiś ca tathaivaikātma sarvadā)\n\nThe moonlight cannot be called as an aspect separate from the moon. Likewise the sun and its heat are inseparable. The same holds true for the supreme consciousness and his energy. Shiva and Parvati are one and the same."
