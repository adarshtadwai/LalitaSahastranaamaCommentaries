  "meaning": "She loves pāyasānna.",
  "commentary": "During the first month of pregnancy, the expecting mother should offer pāyasānna to the Supreme Mother and thereafter consume it. Consuming this dish during the first month of pregnancy has immense health benefits for the growing foetus.\n\nYogis who are at the Vishuddha chakra and are trying to cross over it should exclusively consume pāyasānna albeit in limited quantities.\n\n1 cup raw rice; 2 cups milk (can be substituted with half cup milk and balance water); ½ cup cow’s ghee, ½ cup green gram (whole moong) and jaggery as required for sweetness.Cook rice and moong in milk (water can be added as explained above). Add required quantity of jaggery for sweetness.  Add ghee. Under no circumstances should sugar be added.\n\nThose in yogic path should consume food in very limited quantities. Body should be flexible and light for yogic progress. Excessive eating causes drowsiness and distracts mind from yoga.\n\nTo offer any preparation as naivedya to the deity, one should necessarily be pure in heart and body. With clean clothes, using clean vessels the food should be prepared in complete purity."
