  "name_transliterated": "Ayi",
  "meaning": "Ayi is the stage at the merger of Tat and Tvam. ‘You’ are ‘that’.",
  "commentary": "In the two earlier names one explained the object far away as ‘tat’ and the second explained the individual self as ‘tvam’. They explained that both entities were Her forms. Ayi now emphasizes that ‘You are none other than the Divine Mother’. ‘You are that’. Tat tvam ayi (or asi) represents a state of merger with Her.\n\n‘Ayyai namaha’- Obeisance to Her who is everything. This is the true state of realization. This is the truth."
