  "commentary": "Dharmas are all those duties that arise out of the family customs coming down the various generations or those that arise out of the social obligations or national duties. Such dharmic duties should be executed without causing any harm to any other being. Dharma regulates the society and ensures spiritual progress of the person following it. For example the police has a national duty of catching the criminal. In this process if he has to beat the criminal it is justified, but a civilian going and simply attacking another is adharma (un-righteous)."
