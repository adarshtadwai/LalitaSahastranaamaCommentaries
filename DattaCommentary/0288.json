  "meaning": "She delivers the results/ fruits (phala) for all the deeds –good and bad.",
  "commentary": "Actions can be classified as good or bad. Good actions are the meritorious deeds that lead to accumulation of punya (merit) while bad actions lead to accumulation of pāpa (apunya, sin). Meritorious deeds include genuinely thinking about the well being of others, undertaking good deeds that benefit them, entertaining good and healthy thoughts and not harming others even in thoughts. The reverse of this is pāpa (sin). The onus of performing the action rests with the individual. She delivers the fruits of these actions on to the individual.\n\nMany a time different people who perform identical actions are rewarded with different results. This is because the outcome depends upon of the balance of punya-pāpa (merit-sin) in their individual account. There is a profound saying- ‘you can choose to compliment others but you cannot demand admiration from others.’ Recognition, reward or appreciation for a good deed should not be sought. Even appreciation arises out of the balance of punya in the individual’s account. Various instances when service to others goes unrecognized happen due to lack of adequate good balance in the individual’s account."
