  "meaning": "She is indestructible.",
  "commentary": "Nirupaplavā can be split into two ways for a better understanding of its meaning.\n\n1) Upaplava means ‘destructible’. Everything created is subject to destruction. But the Supreme power is indestructible; it is eternal and hence is Nir+upaplava.\n\n2) ‘Plava’ means that which is used to cross over. ‘Upaplava’ means that which is helpful in quickly crossing over- here it refers to ‘quickly crossing over the cycles of birth and death (samsara), ignorance (ajnana, avidya), sorrows and difficulties’. Nir+upaplava therefore implies that She is over and above these cycles and hence does not have any necessity to cross over these.\n\nThrough various different names, the same concept i.e. the fact that ‘She is eternal and indestructible’ is being re-iterated. This is because, the human mind that believes in the concepts of beginning & end, birth & death, and needs to slowly absorb this great truth.\n\nNirupaplava also means that She is devoid of vikāra (changes)."
