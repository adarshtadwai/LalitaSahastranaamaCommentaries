  "commentary": "(This is one single nama and should be read without a break.)\n\nMukhya rākānta means ‘the most important full moon’. A given year has 12 full moons. On what basis can anyone among them be said to be the most important? How is that full moon to be identified?\n\nThe months in the Indian calendar have been named based on the location of the full moon in that month. The month in which the full moon is located in Star Jyeshta has been named Jyeshta. In the month of Vaishaka, the full moon will be located in the Star Vishaka. Likewise on Ashwayuja Pournima, the moon will be at Star Ashwini on.\n\nAs ‘Ashwini’ is the first among the 27 stars, it is said to be ‘the most important star’. Correspondingly the full moon of this month assumes great significance and is called mukhya rākānta (most important full moon). Ashwayuja month comes around September-October. It is in this month that Devi Navaratri worship (for 9 nights) takes place. In other words, the full moon that comes immediately after the Navaratri celebrations is the most important full moon of the year.\n\nAs per astronomy, the moon is bigger and brighter on this full moon and it is known as harvest moon. Some traditions celebrate this full moon as the beginning of new-year. Worshipping the Supreme Mother for 9 nights (navaratri) is a well known tradition, but lesser known is the fact that some traditions continue this worship for 15 nights (up to full moon).\n\nShe bestows special blessings on those who worship Her during this period."
