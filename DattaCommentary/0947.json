  "name_transliterated": "Pañca-preta-mañcādhi-śāyinī",
  "meaning": "She is seated on the cot that is made up of the Pancha-pretas.",
  "commentary": "(This is one single name hence do not pause after reciting ‘pancha’)\n\nBrahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Shiva and Sadāshiva (Eshwara) form Her seat/ cot. Shiva is the central plank while the other 4 deities are the legs that support the cot. Inherently these five are corpses (pretas)- She fills the life-consciousness (chaitanya) into them and thereafter they are ready to take on the tasks allotted to them. This proves that She is at the Parabrahma level."
