  "name_devanagari": "तत्त्वासना",
  "name_transliterated": "Tatvāsanā",
  "meaning": "Tattvas (the 24 secret principles that are the root of all this creation) are like a seat (asana) upon which She is seated.",
  "commentary": "The 24 principles behind this creation are- Mahat, ahamkara, mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), the 5 organs of perception (Jnanendriyas) and the 5 organs of action (karmedriyas), the 5 subtle elements (tanmatras) and the 5 physical gross elements (earth, water, fire, wind and space). Amongst them, Mahat is the principle of cosmic intelligence and is the fundamental source behind creation. This is the most superior/ subtlest principle that supports this creation.\n\nAlthough the creation stems out of these principles, they are inert (jada) in themselves. As the Supreme Mother fills the life force (chaitanya) into them She is the root energy. Hence it is said that these principles are a seat upon which She is seated.Tattvam is composed of 2 words- tat+ tvam. Understand the Supreme, understand His nature (bhava), His residence and His mind because understanding the Absolute helps us in understanding of the self."
