  "meaning": "She is over and above righteousness (dharma) and unrighteousness (adharma). This represents the essence of the Supreme (Parabrahma tattva).",
  "commentary": "(Dharmas are the set of rules of righteousness that support and maintain the regulatory order of the universe).\n\nHaving described Her universal (composite Brahmanda or samishti) state, Lalita Sahasranama now comes to the individual (pindanda or vyasti) state.\n\nEach living being experiences 3 states of existence- wakeful (jāgrat) state, dream state (swapna) and deep sleep (śuśupti) state. These 3 states of experience are not merely limited to humans, but to all living beings including plants and trees. The truth is that trees and plants also go through a dream state. Aren’t they living things that possess consciousness?\n\nThese three states that are experienced by the individual being are explained from here until name 263."
