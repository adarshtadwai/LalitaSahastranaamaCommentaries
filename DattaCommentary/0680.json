  "name_devanagari": "भावाभावविवर्जिता",
  "name_transliterated": "Bhāvābhāva-vivarjitā",
  "meaning": "She is beyond the states of bhāva and abhāva.",
  "commentary": "Let us assume that bhāva stands for a rope. Then abhāva is to mistake the rope for a snake. What is true is the rope; what is imagined is a snake. Hence bhāva is that which is existing while abhāva is that which is non-existing and imagined. She is beyond both these.\n\nThe same is explained in chapter 2 of Bhagavad Gita –\n\nnāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate satah |ubhayorapi drishtoantastvanayostattvadarsibhih"
