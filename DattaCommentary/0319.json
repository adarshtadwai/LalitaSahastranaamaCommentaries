  "name_devanagari": "रामा",
  "name_transliterated": "Rāmā",
  "meaning": "She plays joyfully in the heart of the devotee/ yogi. She gives limitless joy and contentment.",
  "commentary": "‘Rāmā’ is not a name but is a title. It is a title for that person or energy who gives limitless contentment and joy (Ramayati). For uncountable eons great eminent saints such as Vashistha performed relentless penance. Yet they could not experience that limitless supreme bliss. At the time of Rāmā’s birth Maharishi Vashistha visited the palace. The mere sight of the infant filled his heart with limitless joy and he was blessed with the contentment that he was seeking all these eons. He aptly named the infant ‘Rāmā’.\n\nThe Supreme Mother showers this bliss and is Rāmā. Rāmā is the essence of Goddess Lakshmi (Lakshmi tattva) and depicts in totality the seed-letter ‘Sreem’."
