  "meaning": "Her neck (kantha) is dark black in colour. From this it can be understood that-",
  "commentary": "a) She has retained the kāla (time or Yama) in Her neck.\n\nRetaining ‘time’ at the point of Her neck reflects Her limitless compassion towards Her children and towards the entire creation. She retains the entire creation in Her womb. By holding kāla (time) at Her neck, She is safe guarding this creation from destruction.\n\nb) She has retained the halahala poison in Her throat.\n\nShiva consumed the Halāhala poison that emerged during the churning of the ocean.  To prevent the poison from entering the stomach, the Supreme Mother placed four of her fingers on His neck and blocked it. With this, the poison remained in His neck, rendering it bluish-black in colour. Moreover, the Divine Mother, being a compassionate and dutiful wife assumed her position as His left half (the ardha nareeshwara pose, wherein the right side is Shiva and left is Devi) and shared his suffering, due to which Her neck too turned bluish- black.\n\nBe it the day to day activities in life or in yoga sadhana, emergence of obstacles is a necessary phenomenon. The good and the bad occurrences are all a part of the churning of the ocean of our life."
