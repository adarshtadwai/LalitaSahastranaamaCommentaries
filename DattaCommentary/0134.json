  "name_transliterated": "Nirlepā",
  "meaning": "The Sun is the eye (chakshu) for all the worlds (sarva loka). This Sun is unaffected by any defect/ blemish in the visible external eye of the individual. Likewise the inner being (atma) within all the beings is untouched by any happening. He is Nirlepa.",
  "commentary": "Our Upanishads state-Surya यथा (yathā) sarva-lokasya cakśur na lipyate cak- susair bāhya-dośaihekas ल्हथा (lhathā) sarva-bhutāntar- ātma na lipyate loka-duhkhēna bāhyah\n\nDue to the Sun’s light we perceive objects. The Sun cannot get contaminated just because a person, due to his defective vision finds deficiencies in the Sun. Based on the colour of the glasses worn the Sun appears different to different eyes. Yet the fact remains that the Sun is untouched by any of these. Likewise the Supreme Mother who is the inner being (antar atma) within all beings is unaffected."
