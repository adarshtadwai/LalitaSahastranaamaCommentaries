  "name_devanagari": "महाकामेशनयनकुमुदाह्लादकौमुदी",
  "name_transliterated": "Mahā-kāmeśa-nayana-kumudahlāda-kaumudī",
  "meaning": "Just as the kumuda (water lily that flowers purely at night) joyously flowers when caressed by the moon rays, Mahā Kameśa flowers in Her divine company. She is pleasing to the eye (nayana) of Mahā Kameśa (Shiva).",
  "commentary": "On the surface level, this name signifies the importance of need for unity and love between the partners in the marriage.\n\nAt the deeper level, every aspirant, be it a man or a woman, is MahaKamesha. Her sight is very pleasing and cooling to the mind of the devout aspirant.\n\nKu means earth; Kumuda means ‘that which causes joy to Mother Earth’. Goddess Lakshmi has manifested in the form of Mother Earth. Mother earth is pleased when a human being who offers service to others and is helpful to the society is born. Presence of spiritual aspirants (sadhakas) and those who are on the righteous path brings to Her great happiness. They are gems who bring glory to Mother Earth. The simile of the water lily and moon rays explains this joy.\n\nNayana also means ‘to take’. She takes such sadhakas to their goal i.e. to the Lord. Only energy (shakti) can take the person towards God. Without energy, nothing is possible."
