  "commentary": "Earlier in the Lalita Sahasranama through the names भक्ति-गम्या (Bhakti-gamyā) (nama 119), Bhakti-vaśyā (nama 120), antar yaaga samārādhya, the various methods of attaining Her were detailed. Now yet another method of reaching Her i.e. dhyana as an important tool for sadhana is being taught.\n\nBhagavad Gita in its beginning verse states –\n\nyam brahma varunendra Rudra marutah stunvanti divyaih stavairvedaih sānga-pada-kramopanishadair gāyanti yam sāma-gāhdhyāna vasthita-tad-gatena मनसा (manasā) pasyanti yam yoginoyasyāntam na viduh सुरासुर-गना (surāsura-ganā) devāya tasmai namah\n\nDhyana is one of the important steps in ashtānga yoga (8 fold process of Yoga). The first 5 steps of the Ashtānga Yoga are external compliances and rituals that concern the physical body. The last 3 i.e. Dhārana,Dhyāna and Samādhi are inner practices (antar yāga). Fixing the mind firmly without giving it a scope to move is dhārana. Mind is fixed at the navel, heart or at the centre of the eyebrows (brukuti). Only then can the mind contemplate on that Absolute. Thoughts that pertain only to this Absolute now exist in the mind. This stage is Dhyana. The Supreme Parabrahma can be reached through such Dhyana."
