  "commentary": "निष्काम (Niṣkāma) is a state of complete contentment and calmness that is above likes, dislikes and wants. The mind that entertains desires cannot be calm. The Supreme Mother aids us in reaching such a state of complete calmness.\n\nThe Supreme Lord being over and above desires, is known as Sampoorna kāma. The Vedas state that this Supreme Lord entertained only one desire –Prajāpati akāmayata praja srujayaiti–  which means ‘I want to create; to see myself in various bodies’. This fundamental desire of the Lord led to this creation."
