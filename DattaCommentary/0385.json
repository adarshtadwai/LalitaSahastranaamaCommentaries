  "meaning": "She has no witness to record Her deeds/ actions.",
  "commentary": "She is the ultimate witness; the ultimate power in this creation. There is no power that can act as a witness to Her actions. Witness is necessary for one who acts and thinks with a wavering mind. She is devoid of all actions (nish kriya) and sankalpas (intentions) and hence is over and above the need for a witness."
