  "name_devanagari": "निश्चिन्ता",
  "name_transliterated": "Niśchintā",
  "meaning": "The funeral pyre (छिता) ((chitā)) envelops the dead body and reduces it to ashes. However the fire called छिन्ता (chintā) (worries, anxieties) burns out a living entity itself!",
  "commentary": "‘Chinta’ means unnecessary thoughts and worries and includes the grief/ sorrow that accompany it. An individual is tormented by chinta whenever events contrary to the liking of the mind take place. Such worry and grief (chinta) is destructive, dangerous and harmful.\n\nछिता दहति निर्जीवम्, छिन्ता दहति जीवितम् (chitā dahati nirjīvam, chintā dahati jīvitam)\n\nWhile ‘छिन्ताऽ (‘chintā’) is to worry and think about useless matters, ‘chinatana’ means to reflect and contemplate about the Almighty. Chintana paves the way towards the Almighty while chinta paves the way to destruction."
