  "meaning": "He who has witnessed the creation of the first being is Vishwādhikā. Only he who possesses the capacity to create the universe, sustain it and thereafter merge/ absorb it completely into Himself is entitled to be addressed as ‘Vishwādhikā’.",
  "commentary": "The word ‘Vishwa’ at the microcosm level refers to the individual’s waking state (jāgrat avastha; refer nama 256 ‘Vishwaroopa jāgarini’) and at the composite (macrocosm) level it refers to the entire universe.\n\n‘Rudra’ is also known as ‘Vishwādhikā’.\n\nVedas state –  Vishvādhiyo  rudro maharishi:hiranyagarbham pashyata jayamanagum dsano devas shubhayaa ssmrubya samyunakthu\n\nSuch a state is known as the ‘Tureeya state’ (the 4th state of existence) and can be achieved only from the ‘waking state’. It is to state that Turiya state is the end point of all states of existence.\n\nAmong the four fold aims of life- Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Moksha, the last one Moksha (liberation) is the most superior state and the ultimate destination for every being. Dharma, artha and kāma should be utilized to achieve salvation (moksha). Likewise here achieving the fourth state (Tureeya) is the goal of all spiritual pursuits (Sadhana). Thus, in both the cases, the fourth states are the foundation for all other states.\n\nVishwa-adhika also means that She is the light for the universe. The universe benefits due to Her presence."
