  "name_devanagari": "विष्णुमाया",
  "name_transliterated": "Viṣṇu-māyā",
  "meaning": "This divine illusion, consisting of gunas (traits), is extremely difficult to overcome.  I am the creator of this illusion. Whoever surrenders to me, turning away from the world, succeeds in crossing the terrible māyā.",
  "commentary": "Vishnu māya is said to be the supreme most illusion, an illusion that is all-pervading and that which encompasses everything and anything on its path. As this illusion envelops this entire creation, every being who is within it, is necessarily under its control. This illusion causes the being to believe that he is the body and that this body is everything. It makes him believe that what he is seeing is true and permanent. This is a divine illusion that is encompassed of all the gunas. In his incarnation as Krishna, the Supreme Lord totally displayed this illusion (Vishnu māya).\n\nBut for Her grace it is impossible to cross over this illusion. Only those who surrender to Her divine feet and seek refuge can cross over to the other side.\n\nLord Krishna explains about this in Bhagavad Gita –\n\nDaivi hyesha gunamayee mama māyā दुरत्यया,मामेव (duratyayā,Māmeva) ye prapadyante māyāmetām taranti te."
