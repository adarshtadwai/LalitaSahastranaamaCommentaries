The word Bhaga in Bhagawati represents this.\n\n2) She has worn the 12 Suns (Bhaga) as a garland around Her neck (mala).\n\nBhaga is one of the names of the Lord Sun. Our ancient scriptures have declared authentically that our solar system consists of totally 12 suns viz., Mitra, Ravi, Surya, Bhanu, Khaga, Poosha, Hiranyagarbha, Maricha, Aditya,\n\nSavitra, Arka, Bhaskara. All of these influence the life on earth. As She is shining brightly with these 12 Suns that are strewn into a garland around Her neck, She is Bhaga Mālini."
