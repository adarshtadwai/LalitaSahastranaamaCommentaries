  "commentary": "लक्स्ह्मि लक्स्ह्यते सर्वहा अनि नेति लक्स्ह्मी (Lakshmi lakshyate sarvahā ani neti lakshmī)\n\n‘Lakshyate’ means goal, aim or measure. She is the goal for all beings. It is through Her that we can reach the goal. Hence She is Lakshmi.\n\nGoddess Lakshmi is a witness to every action and to every thought. She is the energy which is the cause for sustenance and which enables the being to see, hear, talk, think, perceive and so on.\n\nLakshmi also refers to sampada (wealth & prosperity). Prosperity is crucial for sustenance. Hence She is addressed as the Goddess of prosperity. As the deity for sustenance, She is worshipped daily in Her 8 forms (Ashta Lakshmi), all of which bestow the essentials for living. For example, Dhānya Lakshmi is the Goddess who showers food grains, Vidya Lakshmi bestows knowledge, Dhairya Lakshmi blesses with courage etc. All these are forms that have emerged out of Her.\n\nSri Suktam of the Vedas praises Her as –\n\nSiddha lakshmi moksha lakshmir jayalakshmi saraswati,Sri lakshmir vara lakshmi cha prasanna bhava sarvada.\n\nThese are Her forms that bestow siddhi (accomplishment), jaya (victory) and moksha (liberation). Addressing Her as Saraswati re-iterates that She is the Goddess of learning (vidya). She is Sri Lakshmi, Vara Lakshmi (giver of boons).\n\nReciting hymns and offering puja and worshipping Her, especially with coins, during the month of Sraavana is very auspicious. Offering coins to Her is symbolic of offering that which sustains us i.e. money."
