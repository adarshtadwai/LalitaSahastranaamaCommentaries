  "meaning": "She is worshipped with the 10 mudras that are offered to Her at the end of the worship.",
  "commentary": "Mudra binds the nādis (astral nerves) in the body. These nādis have their ending at the fingertips. When two fingers touch each other, two different nādis-streams merge. An unseen vibration flows within us at such times. Each mudra supplies different vibration and different energy. Simha mudra, Kacchapi mudra, Kechari mudra are all names of different commonly heard mudras.\n\nAt the end of Srichakra puja or Navavarana puja She is worshipped with 10 mudras starting from Samkshobini mudra to Trikhanda mudra. These mudras have to be taken as an initiation from a Guru and then practiced."
