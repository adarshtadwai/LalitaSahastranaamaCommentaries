  "meaning": "She is the supreme force behind the task of dissolution.",
  "commentary": "She empowers Rudra (Shiva) with the tamo guna as well as the energy needed to complete the task of dissolution.\n\n‘Samhāra’ in common understanding is confused with killing or destruction. One should remember that this is not true. Can there be a mother who will kill her children? The term samhāra refers to dissolution/ absorption. The Supreme Mother, out of love for her child, absorbs him into Her. Thus She brings an end to all his sufferings. When a devotee utters the prayer ‘ॐ (‘Om) samhārinye namaha’- he is seeking the destruction of unnecessary sankalpas (intentions) that arise in his mind and is blessed accordingly."
