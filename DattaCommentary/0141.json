  "meaning": "She is an embodiment of peace.",
  "commentary": "Every person displays 9 emotions (rasas) – Shringāra (beauty, love), hāsya (happiness, mirth), adbhuta (wonder, surprise), bhaya (fear), karuna (compassion), vibhatsya (disgust), veera (courage), krodha (anger) and shānti (peace). The mind jumps from one emotion to another.\n\nThe Supreme Mother however knows only one emotion and this is to be eternally at peace (shānti). Mother, in Her form as Goddess Durga, may appear externally ferocious, but this appearance is only to eliminate the bad traits, ferocious behaviour and bad habits within us and render us peaceful."
