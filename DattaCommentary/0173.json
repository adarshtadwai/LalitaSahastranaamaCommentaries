  "meaning": "When the sadhaka directly sees ‘Me’ as Paramatma seated in the hearts of all living beings, the knot in his heart is cut and all of his doubts are shredded. All the bad karmas performed until those moments are completely nullified.",
  "commentary": "भिद्यते ह्रिदय-ग्रन्थिस् छिद्यन्ते सर्व-सम्शयह्क्शियन्ते चस्य कर्माणि मयि द्रिस्ह्ते ऽपरावरे (Bhidyate hridaya-granthis chidyante sarva-samśayahkśiyante casya karmāṇi mayi drishte ’parāvare)\n\nKnot in the heart (hrudaya granthi) refers to the various samshayas (doubts) that exist. When such knots are cut into tiny pieces the person is rendered absolutely pure (nirmala, shuddha). Such a state is achieved on seeing the Lord. However it is up to the being to put in the right efforts to see the Lord."
