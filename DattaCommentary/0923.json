  "name_transliterated": "Dakṣiṇā-dakṣiṇārādhyā",
  "meaning": "She accepts the worship offered by both the knowledgeable and capable persons (jnanis) as well as the ignorant (ajnani).",
  "commentary": "Dakshina refers to the learned persons who are proficient in knowledge. They possess the capacity to offer worship and are called Dakshas. Adakshina refers to the ignorant who know nothing about God and worship.\n\nDakshina is the offering that is made to the teacher or to the person conducting any ritual on one’s behalf, based on individual capacity. It is not right to accept services from another free of cost. Yagna will be rendered fruitless if the Dakshina is not settled then and there. She is pleased when Dakshina is duly offered to teachers.\n\nDakshinaradhya is also a method in Srichakra worship."
