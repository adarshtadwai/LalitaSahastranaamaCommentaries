  "name_transliterated": "Sarva-tantra-rūpā",
  "meaning": "Just as all the water falling from the sky ultimately ends up in the ocean, all salutations (namaskaara) offered to all the Gods ultimately reach the single Supreme Almighty.",
  "commentary": "Sarva-tantra-rūpā is one name. Therefore during recitation the following practice should be adopted- Sarva-yantrātmikā (pause) Sarva-tantra-rūpā Manonmani.\n\nThe common man erroneously believes that ‘tantra’ refers to the worship that is replete with black magic and human/animal sacrifices (bali). The word ‘bali’ truly means puja.\n\nTantra means that which is vast and spread out. The tiny yantra and mantra now expand vastly into tantra. Elaborate and detailed worship of the Almighty that are prescribed are tantric procedures. Tantra also means knowledge (vidya).\n\nOne of the Prayers to the Supreme is as follows –\n\nआकाशाथ् पतितम् तोयम् यथा गछ्छ्हति सागरम्सर्वदेव नमस्कारह् केशवम् प्रति गछ्छ्हति (ākāśāth patitam toyam yathā gachchhati sāgaramsarvadeva namaskārah keśavam prati gachchhati)\n\nWe should understand that every mantra, yantra and tantra adopted for worship, leads towards Her alone."
