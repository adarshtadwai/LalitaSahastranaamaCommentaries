  "name_transliterated": "Rākṣasaghnī",
  "meaning": "She is the annihilator of demons.Deities (Devatas) and demons co-exist. The good and the bad thoughts within the individual are the Devatas and the demons respectively. The churning that takes place in the mind due to this, is the churning of the ocean (amruta mathana). These mental demons wreck havoc in the mind. In addition to these mental demons, there also exist physical demons. Of course, they do not possess horns and dreadful face unlike their counterparts of earlier eons.",
  "commentary": "The present day demons look like us, speak sweetly but yet carry out heinous deeds. Don’t we come across such people in this world?\n\nHe who, giving up thoughts of his own comforts and welfare reaches out to others who are in despair and seeks to uplift them is a Devata. To such person welfare of others gives most peace and joy. He who, takes care or seeks the welfare of others while seeking his own welfare is a madhyama (human). The third category consists of people who seek purely their own comforts and welfare. Towards achieving this they inflict trouble on others. They are human- rakshasas (demons in human form). They destroy the happiness of others for their selfish welfare and happiness.  People of the fourth category harm others and in the process neither do they procure any happiness nor cause benefit to others. Such people are beyond all classifications and have no name.\n\nDestroying demons means that the Supreme Mother ensures that good thoughts and feelings are cultivated even in such demonic personalities. It does not mean that She would take her trident and descend from heaven to kill them physically. It should be understood that She causes a transformation in such persons."
