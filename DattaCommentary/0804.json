  "commentary": "a) She is Pushkara of the river.\n\nPushkara is the very auspicious time for a particular river; the combination of Jupiter and the zodiac sign results in its Pushkara. At the time of Pushkara the supreme energy in the form of all the Devatas are said to reside in that river and hence bathing in the river and offering it worship are considered very auspicious. The medicinal properties of that river increase multi fold at such time.\n\nb) Pushyati avakaasham  akasha roopena iti pushkara- She provides the opportunity for our spiritual growth and hence She is called Pushkara.\n\nc) Pushkara refers to yoga. She is the form of yoga and hence is Pushkara. Arunopanishad states- pushkara parnai pushkara dandai.. which means- She loves the pushkara parnai (lotus flowers); pushkara danda (lotus stem) and hence is Pushkara.\n\nThe lotus blooms beautifully even when it is situated in mire and mud. This is to teach us irrespective of our surroundings we should make efforts to raise and bloom in the spiritual field. As lotus flowers contain such deep symbolism, they are very dear to Her."
