  "meaning": "Only those with meritorious deeds to their credit can reach Her.",
  "commentary": "Merit (punya) is that which is earned through penance (tapas) and charity (daanam). It grants happiness not in this world but in the other worlds.\n\nAdi Shankaraacharya begins the entire Soundarya Lahiri with emphasis on punya.\n\nShiva shaktya yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitumna ched-evam devo na khalu kusalah spanditum api;Atas tvam aradhyam hari-hara-virinchadibhirapi pranantum stotum va kathama-krta-punyah prabhavati.\n\nThe last line in the above verse states that even to hear about Her, sing Her hymn or offer obeisance to Her, the individual should possess a balance of merit (punyah) to his credit.\n\nThe balance of punya (merit, virtue) that one possesses is the determining factor for his/her attraction towards God. If even to enter a temple or to think of God the person should have tremendous amount of punya to his credit then can you imagine the balance of punya that would be necessary to enable a person to recite hymns or to worship the Almighty? People with no balance of merit to their credit cannot even visit the temple at the right hour."
