  "name_transliterated": "Niṣkalā",
  "meaning": "Shiva obtains the power to create only when He is united with śakti (energy). In its absence the Supreme Lord cannot even move.",
  "commentary": "a) She is without any movement (spandana).\n\nśodaśa kaḷā vo puruśah– Every person has the sixteen essential factors i.e. 16 kalās within him and these kalās are essential for life. Among them the prānakala (life energy) is the most vital and is known as the 16th kala. When this 16th kala departs, the person dies. To an ordinary being, this is a state of निस्ह्कला (nishkalā) (devoid of kala).\n\nThe first stanza of Soundarya Lahiri states –\n\nशिवः (Śivaḥ) śaktyā yuktō yadi bhavati शक्तः (śaktaḥ) प्रभवितुंन (prabhavituṃna) cē देवं (devaṃ) devō na khalu kuśalah spanditum api.\n\nHere, Shiva does not mean the Lord Shiva who holds the trident and who has Ganga on His crest. ‘Shiva’ refers to the human body. Unless the body has life force (Shakti) it cannot move. In its absence, it is a dead body (shava). Hence, a combination of Shiva and Shakti is primary requisite for life and this is the 16th kala.\n\nb) The Supreme Mother, who does not wear a human body, is over and above all these Kalas.\n\nGods are called ‘animesha’ as they do not have a body and hence have no movement (spandana). Even the slightest movement such as movement of eyelids will be absent."
