  "meaning": "She is the form of sound (nāda).",
  "commentary": "Sound is the basis for creation. Every baby cries at birth. Sound (nāda) is subtly hidden within the being in an unmanifest state (avyakta) at the Anahata chakra. At the time of speech, it becomes audible. The aspirant who worships Narayani and who is able to focus his mind inwards will be able to hear this inner sound.\n\nNāda originates from na+ada which means- ‘that which cannot eat us’. In fact it protects and nourishes us. Those who undertake music as a form of worship (upasana) or who listen to soothing music as an upasana are able to visualize Her."
