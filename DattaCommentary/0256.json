  "meaning": "She takes on the form of this universe (Viśwa).",
  "commentary": "‘Viśwa’ is commonly understood to mean the universe at large. However, the term Viśwa refers to the body (the individual, pindanda). The entire world in reality exists within the individual. It is simply projected /visualized in the external world.\n\nIn the wakeful state (jāgrat avastha) the ‘being’ exists in the gross body (sthoola shareera) and is called Viśwa. It is aware of its body, its existence and is fully conscious. ‘जागरणऽ (‘Jāgaraṇa’) means ‘to be awake’. The seed letter (beejakshara) connected to this state is ‘A’-kaara. The trait (guna) that rules this state is the Sattva (traits of purity)."
