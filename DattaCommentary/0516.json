  "commentary": "This emphasizes that She blesses every being with healthy bones. The spine is the most important bone in the human system.\n\nAt this point She takes on the form of Rāhu (Rāhu Swaroopini). It is said that Rāhu and Ketu reside in the Mooladhara (the base chakra). The planet Rāhu has a close connection to the bones within the body. For bone related problems, oil lamp is lit during the rahu kaalam. There exists a great ancient science of mapping the nine planets (Navagrahas) with the six spiritual centres within the body."
