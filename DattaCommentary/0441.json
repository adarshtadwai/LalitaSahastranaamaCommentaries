  "name_transliterated": "Kaula-mārga-tatpara-sevitā",
  "meaning": "Koula mārga refers to the pure path of yoga. She adores the offerings made by those spiritual aspirants who strictly abide by the Koula Marga.",
  "commentary": "Koula marga is misconstrued to mean tantric practices involving animal sacrifices and other tantric procedures. Such practices are not permitted and hence are unacceptable to Her. The truth is that the Supreme Parabrahma, who is being worshipped here in His female form, is actually attainable only through pure worship. Hence it is this pure path of yoga that is being referred to here."
