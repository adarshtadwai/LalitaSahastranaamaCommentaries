  "commentary": "What happens to the soul after death? Having left the earthly body the being now merges into the infinite. In its un-manifest (avyakta) state, it becomes all pervading.\n\nThe person who gives up all attachments, anger and other bondages is able to merge permanently into the infinite. He will be all pervading.\n\nWith this name, Lalita Sahasranama moves into the fifth enclosure. The last name of the previous enclosure introduces the concepts that are to be taught now."
