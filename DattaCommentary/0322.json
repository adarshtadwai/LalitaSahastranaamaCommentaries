  "name_transliterated": "Kāmakalā rūpā",
  "meaning": "Desire or inner sankalpa (desire, intent) is the root for all action. It exists subtly in an invisible state deep within. It is not ‘I’ who performed the action. Desire is the karta (the doer of the action). Desire (kaama) is causing the performance of the action (kārayita). I am not the cause. Hence all these intentions and desires are offered to you (swaha) O Lord Kāma Kāmeshwara.",
  "commentary": "Both desires and arts (kāmakalā) are aspects of energy (shakti). Being able to have the right intention and the right desire is itself an art. The person should be able to know what to seek. This is where the demons go awry. Trying to be over-smart they seek boons that ultimately lead to their destruction. Actions originate out of intentions deeply hidden within us. Desire is said to be the root of all actions. The Vedas explain this lucidly.\n\nFor example, let us understand the meaning of the following verse from Krishna yajurveda –\n\nKāmokarśin namo namah. Kāmonakarishit kāmah karoti nāham karomi kāmah karta nāham karta kāmah kārayita nāham kārayita eshad te kāma kāmāya swāha.\n\nAs a composite form of all intentions She takes on the name Kāmakalā rūpā.\n\nHere, the Supreme Essence is being segregated into two- one as motionless Shiva and the other as energy (Shakti). This is the Ardha nāreshwara tattva (half male- half female essence) which is a step below the total united essence. Shiva or Supreme Consciousness (Shuddha chaitanya) is motionless. It is the Supreme Energy (Shakti) that causes movement in Him. She causes in him the intent to create."
