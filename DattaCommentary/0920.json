  "name_transliterated": "Sadoditā",
  "meaning": "One who eternally (सदा) ((sadā)) rises like the Sun is सदोदिता। (sadoditā.) She shines eternally.",
  "commentary": "She is ever rising in our intellect. If not, our intellect would be totally rotten. A yogi is able to witness this effulgence within him at all times. To such a person even though the visible external Sun has set, the inner Sun continues to glow endlessly. She shines eternally in the person who is able to offer true chaitanya archana (discussed in the above name)."
