  "commentary": "‘Anahata chakra’ is located near the heart and is below the Vishuddha chakra. ‘Anahata’ refers to the inner sound that originates on its own without any friction. The yogi who reaches the stage of Anahata begins to hear these sounds. It is the sound of creation (the primordial sound).\n\nThe deity of this chakra is Vāmadevi (refer nama 469).  As She vomits the entire creation that has so far been retained in her womb, She is Vāmadevi.\n\nThe process of formation of the head of the foetus begins in the first month of pregnancy (refer nama ‘Khatvaangaadi Praharana’) extends during the second month too. The Divine Mother blesses the foetus with a strong and healthy head during this time."
