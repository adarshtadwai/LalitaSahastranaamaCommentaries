  "meaning": "She is devoid of the sense of individuality (ego, aham).",
  "commentary": "This is a very significant, useful and special name. It is stated that the entire yoga is contained within this word and in understanding of its essence. Understanding and adopting this is a major milestone in spiritual progress.\n\nAhamkara exists at 2 stages – individual and universal. While the former is harmful and destructive (as it is based out of self-centeredness), the latter is greatly beneficial. Individual ego revolves around the feelings of self-importance such as ‘I, mine, my’ and so on. Universal ego means to see himself in every being. By adopting the universal ego approach, it is very easy to get rid of ego in totality.\n\nAhamkara has 3-subdivisions – Sattvik ahamkara, Rajasic ahamkara and Tamasic ahamkara. Our actions stem out of the type of guna (trait) that rules the mind. The chapter ‘Gunatraya – Vibhāga Yoga’ of Bhagavad Gita preaches how ahamkara should be given up. When a person feels –‘I am sattvik’ then he is being ruled by Sattvik ahamkara. Among the 3 sub-divisions, sattvik ahamkara is the best, for it causes the person to do good and meritorious deeds. Yet, even this needs to be given up.\n\nThe roots of ahamkara spread into all the 3 states – gross, subtle and causal. At first the ego at the gross (waking) state should be destroyed; only after that can the ego of the other 2 states can be eliminated."
