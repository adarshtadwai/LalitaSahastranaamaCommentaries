  "commentary": "‘Sa’ is Her seed letter and She is also known as Goddess Siddha-vidya (refer nama 472).\n\nThis chakra corresponds to the fifth month of pregnancy. The backbone (spine) begins to develop in the foetus. Thus this month is most crucial for the development of the foetus. The face, nose, eyes and ears are formed in this period and are now clearly visible. In these modern days, the expecting mother is advised to undergo an ultrasound test (scan) so as to measure the growth of the foetus. The Supreme Mother seated within the womb of the physical mother is guarding the foetus at every step of its growth.\n\nThe dhyana shloka for Saakini devi is-\n\nMooladhaarasta padme shruti dala lasite pancha vaktraam trinetraamDhoomraabhaam asti samsthaam sruni mapi kamalam pustakam Jnana mudraamBhibraanaam baahu dandai sulalita varadaam poorva shaktyaa vrutaantaamMudgannaam sakta chittaam madhu mada muditaam Saakini bhaavayaamaha.\n\nIn this manner the life energy (prana shakti) of the being (foetus) descends via the  Vishuddha chakra to the Mooladhāra and remains seated there. For his spiritual growth, the being has to consciously put in efforts and travel the distance from Mooladhāra to Ajna chakra.\n\nThe names 521 to 527 describe the Divine Mother who is seated in the Ajna Chakra as Hākini Devi."
