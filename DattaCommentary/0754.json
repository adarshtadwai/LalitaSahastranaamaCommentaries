  "name_devanagari": "अपर्णा",
  "name_transliterated": "Aparṇā",
  "meaning": "Devi Parvati lived without eating even leaves when She was seeking the Lord and hence got the name Aparnā. She who relieves her devotees from runa (indebtedness) is Aparnā.",
  "commentary": "Little Parvati undertook intense sadhana for securing Lord Shiva as her husband. For some time She gave up cooked food and lived only on uncooked food. Later, for some period, She lived only on fallen leaves (parna). Subsequently She gave up even eating leaves (aparna) and continued Her sadhana. For undertaking such severe austerities, She was addressed as Aparna.\n\nFasting on certain days has been introduced for a reason. Every part of the body has been given some lifeline during which it can function well. Eating 3 meals on a daily basis puts extreme load on the internal organs and they fail early in life, leading to diseases. Over eating is thus injurious to health. Fasting has been introduced as a ritual in our life so that the body is given rest on that day. At least one day in a week should be set aside for fasting."
