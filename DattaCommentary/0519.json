  "meaning": "The Divine Mother seated at the Mooladhāra chakra should be offered Mudganna as this is dear to Her.",
  "commentary": "Mudganna is also known as Ven-pongal. Cook rice together with a little green gram and pinch of turmeric. To this add salt. Season it with pepper, ginger, ghee and cumin seeds (jeera).\n\nMudganna should be consumed in very limited quantities. Eating excessively heats up the body while eating in limited quantities cools the body. The pepper in it drives away lethargy in the mind. This is a very healthy morning food for children."
