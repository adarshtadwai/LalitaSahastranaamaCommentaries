  "name_transliterated": "Niṣkrodhā",
  "meaning": "Oh Lakshmi Nrsimha! I have become blind (andha). This is because the sense of discrimination (viveka) has been stolen from me. I am totally bound and tied down by the thieves who are none other than my senses (indriya). My blindness has caused me to fall in to the deep well of delusion (moha). The well is very deep and dark. O Lord, Please protect me and lift me up.",
  "commentary": "The 6 inner enemies (the arishadvargas) are kāma (desire), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (attachment), mada (ego) and mātsarya (jealousy). Controlling and driving out this darkness is the aim of life.\n\nSri Adi Shankara Bhagavadpādācharya states in His hymn, Lakshmi Nrusimha Karavalamba stotra –\n\nAndhasya me viveka maha dhanasya,Choraih prabho bhalibhi rindriya nāma dheyaih,Mohānda koopa kuhare vinipātitasya,Lakshmi Nrsimha mama dehi करावलंबं (karāvalaṃbaṃ)\n\nThe darkness or the well referred to above is the result of getting trapped by the inner enemies (arishadvargas)."
