  "commentary": "The word ‘tapas’ (penance) instantly brings to our memory the picture of a saint sitting under a tree in a forest with a rosary in his hand, closing his eyes and performing rigorous meditation. At times the picture could be that of a saint standing on one leg in the forest in deep contemplation. Penance (tapas) includes these and many more.\n\nPenance is broadly classified into 3 types- Shāreerika tapas, vak tapas and mānasika tapas. Shāreerika tapas (shareera means physical body) are the physical efforts through which the person aims to achieve the Supreme. Vak is speech. Controlling the speech and speaking just as much is necessary is vak tapas (penance through speech).Controlling the mind and not allowing it to go astray with unnecessary thoughts is mental penance (mānasika tapas)."
