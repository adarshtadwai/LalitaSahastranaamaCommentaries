  "name_transliterated": "Karuṇārasa-sāgarā",
  "meaning": "She is an ocean (sāgara) of compassion (karuna).",
  "commentary": "Among all the emotions (rasas), compassion (karuna) is the most supreme. Lord Rama was an ocean of compassion. The term ‘ocean’ symbolizes that this flow of compassion is never ending, vast and limitless.\n\nSāgarā also brings to memory the story of Emperor Sagar whose 60,000 sons were granted salvation by the River Ganga. Out of compassion (karuna) the Divine Mother herself took on the form of Ganga and hence She is करुणारस-सागरा। (Karuṇārasa-sāgarā.)"
