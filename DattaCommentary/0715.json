  "commentary": "a) She is worshipped by (āradhya) the Sun God (Bhaga).\n\nThe Sun gets its luster from Her grace and hence with great reverence He worships Her.\n\nb) As per the scripture on alphabets (Akshara Shastra), the vernacular alphabet ‘ae’ is known as Bhaga. This alphabet resembles the triangle (trikona). Trikona (triangle) is Her residence and She is worshipped within it ; hence She is Bhagārādhyā."
