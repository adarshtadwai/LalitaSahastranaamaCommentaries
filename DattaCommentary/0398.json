  "meaning": "She is in an un-manifested, invisible state. This is akin to the moola prakriti state at which point she is invisible.",
  "commentary": "As a fundamental cause She is invisible / subtle. For example, the Rivers Ganga and Kaveri, at their birthplace are tiny rivulets, hardly noticeable and almost invisible. Yet they manifest into large rivers capable of sustaining thousands of people and flow across the breadth of the country.\n\nBefore the formation of the pot, it was in the shape of mud. Even before that there was a time when even this mud did not exist. Various minute atoms had to collect for the formation of the mud particles. Avyakta refers to this state prior to the formation of even the mud particles."
