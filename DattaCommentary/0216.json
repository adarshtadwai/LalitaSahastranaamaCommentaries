  "meaning": "She is the personification of Sattva guna (trait of purity). She is the supreme truth (sat).The 3 main aspects of Parabrahma are ‘Sacchidananda’ i.e. sat +chit+ ananda, where ‘Sat’ stands for the Supreme Truth. She is replete with this ‘Sat’ (ultimate truth) and has complete knowledge of it. She Herself is truth; She is the true existence. She is Parabrahma.",
  "commentary": "There is only one truth and it does not have in it classifications of small, trivial, great and the like. Such truth can only be experienced. Towards achieving this, it is essential that the person should adhere to truth and should perpetually be searching for this truth.\n\nOf the 3 traits (gunas), the traits of purity (sattva) are the most supreme. All those who understand the supreme truth (sat), those who aspire to know the supreme truth (sat), who are drawn towards pure (sattvik) traits are all predominantly sattvik. ‘Maha Sattva’ and ‘Maha Satya’ are synonyms.\n\nThe Divine Mother grants these traits to those devotees who are truly in search of the supreme truth (sat). The term ‘granting such traits’ does not imply a onetime shower on the person but means a slow a minute by minute positive change that takes place in the individual."
