  "name_transliterated": "Ānanda-kalikā",
  "meaning": "She dwells in every being in the form of bliss (ānanda) that is in a budding/ blossoming state.",
  "commentary": "Kalika is the tender flowering bud that is yet to fully blossom. This bud blooms into a flower resulting in infinite bliss.\n\nOne of the 3 basic inherent desires of every being is to be in a state of eternal bliss (Ananda). The individual bliss and the divine bliss are separated by a thin lining known as ahamkara (ego, sense of individuality). Because of this ego, the individual enjoys temporary, periodic bliss. Divinity on the other hand, is free from egotism and therefore enjoys pure eternal bliss."
