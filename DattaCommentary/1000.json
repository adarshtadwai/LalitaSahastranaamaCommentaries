  "name_transliterated": "Lalitāmbika",
  "meaning": "Such a supreme force is worshipped as Mother Goddess Lalita Devi.",
  "commentary": "Laliteti nama yuktam tava kila divyAnavArutah\n\nThus ends the recitation of the 1000 names that was sung by the Vag Devatas themselves. Every aspect of the Divine Mother is divine. Her names are endless. Can there be a limit to that force which playfully creates this universe?\n\nThe total from the beginning and up to the stanza ‘Evam Sri Lalita devya nāmnām sāhasrakam jaguh’ is 182.5 stanzas (each comprising of 2 lines). Thus the total number of lines is 365. This represents the time factor of 1 year. Also it can be understood that half of it represents the feminine factor (prakriti or Devi tattvam) while the other half represents the masculine (Purusha or Shiva tattvam).\n\nLords Hayagriva, Dakshinamurty and Dattatreya are considered as Gurus for the universe. Lord Hayagriva blesses with pure knowledge, Lord Dattatreya with Yoga and Lord Dakshinamurty with silence and knowledge (mouna, Jnana). These three Gurus hold the worship of Goddess Lalita Devi in high esteem. Says Lord Hayagriva to Maharishi Agastya- ‘ reciting the phala sruti (results/fruits) of Lalita Sahasranama also holds immense significance. It is as important as the Sahasranama itself.’"
