  "commentary": "1) She is seated in the lotus pose or it can be said that She is seated on a lotus (padma) which to Her is a seat (āsana).\n\nPadmasana is one of the poses in yoga. Padmasana is a very simple tool to lock (bandha) the flow of life force (prana shakti). It prevents the life force from flowing outwards.\n\n2) Padma also refers to prosperity and She is seated upon it.\n\nGoddess Lakshmi (Goddess of prosperity) is known as Padma. In the Sri Suktam of the Vedas, She is addressed as Padma in the verse- padma priye padmini padma haste पद्मा (padmā) laye padma dala yatāksi. This Goddess blesses the devotee with prosperity, which could be either material prosperity, or in the form of knowledge.\n\nLotus is a very delicate flower, which withers easily and is dependent on the Sun for its life. It teaches us that money/ material prosperity is very insubstantial and can disappear easily."
