  "meaning": "She is the atma (soul) for all Yantras (mystic symbols) in the creation.She manifests in the form of all the Yantras.",
  "commentary": "In a Yantra, various immortal seed letters (amruta mantras) are inscribed. For example, the seed letters (beejaksharas) that relate to the 8 different directions are inscribed at appropriate places; the primary mantra that pertains to the deity (moola mantra) of the Yantra and also the Gayatri mantra connected with it are inscribed on it. In the centre will be the Omkara. In addition, all the vernacular alphabets (akshara) from ‘a’ to ‘ha’ are written all around it. Thus, it helps us visualize the Divine Almighty as a form of sound (mantra, akshara).Yantra can be described as a medium that enables us to visualize the invisible force/ energy.\n\nThere is yet another speciality about the Yantra. It is inscribed on a metal plate. At the centre is the bindu (dot). Holding this central dot, if one pulls it upwards, the Srichakra is created; push the Srichakra back and all that remains is a flat metal plate. Creation is akin to this great philosophy. Out of nothing, a great expansion takes places and everything merges back into nothing.\n\nYantra has a very powerful place in worship. At the time of consecration of the idol, it is the Yantra that is installed primarily at an auspicious hour and duly worshipped amidst the recitation of the holy Vedic chants. The deity to be installed at the temple is invoked into this Yantra. Subsequently the idol is installed.Mantra is a form of sound. Yantra is a form of mystic symbols and alphabets. Worship has progressed from sound to form."
