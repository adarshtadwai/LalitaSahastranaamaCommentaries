  "meaning": "As She is the powerful energy who is born at Sandhya times, She is Sandhya Devi. She is worshipped at each Sandhya times.",
  "commentary": "There are 3 Sandhya times in a day. These are the junctions wherein 2 different times meet e.g.- night and morning, morning and afternoon, evening and night. These times are very powerful for meditation and worship and hence should not be wasted. The truteeya skanda (3rd skanda) of Srimad Bhagavatam tells the story of the birth of Sandhya Devi."
