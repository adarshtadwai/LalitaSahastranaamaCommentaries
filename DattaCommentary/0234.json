  "commentary": "The first step in creation is the triad (set of three, triputi or Tripura). This entire creation is within this Triad. For every aspect, there are 3 constituents viz., subject, object and the process of knowing the object. The person who is undertaking the analysis or learning is the ‘subject’. What he seeks is the ‘object’. The process through which he seeks the object is the third constituent. Such triads can be found in every plane of existence and every aspect in this creation can be broken down into these three constituents."
