  "meaning": "She is like a complete, deep ocean whose end/depth cannot be fathomed.",
  "commentary": "As knowledge increases, humility should increase. This is an indicator of true spiritual growth. With humility, knowledge increases further. The depth of a true jnani (highly knowledgeable person) cannot be measured. He is like the deep unfathomable ocean. The ocean shows its waves only towards the shore; as one travels deeper into the ocean he will observe that it has a calm and stable exterior even though it is deep and endless. In Ramayana, Rama’s character has been described with the phrase- ‘Samudra iva gāmbheerye’"
