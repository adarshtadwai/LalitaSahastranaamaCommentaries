The custom of women wearing waistband (odhyana) was prevalent primarily for the spiritual benefits that it confers.\n\nThe anklets as well as the bells in the waistband of the Divine Mother reverberate with the sounds of the Vedas.\n\n‘Kinkini’ is the sound of the Vedas and it highlights Her connection with naada (sound). Modern science agrees that the universe was created out of sound. It is a well-known fact that sound has the capacity to bring about vibration even in a lifeless object. For example, the glass object kept on the table vibrates when loud music is played.\n\nLikewise, the sound of the Vedas (generated from Her anklets and waistband) causes a movement in the minds of the Devatas, and fills them with enlightenment. These are auspicious sounds that lead to formation of good thoughts and good intellect (buddhi).\n\nThe following 8 names are connected to the seed letter ‘Shree’ (beejakshara). They are special mantras that relieve/ dispel problems and troubles and are to be recited regularly during troubled times and are known as ‘āpad kāla mantras’. They are contained in the verse –\n\nरमा राकेन्दुवदना रतिरूपा रतिप्रियारक्षाकरी राक्षसघ्नी रामा रमण-लम्पटा (Ramā rākenduvadanā ratirūpā ratipriyāRakṣākarī rākṣasaghnī rāmā ramaṇa-lampaṭā)"
