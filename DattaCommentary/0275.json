  "meaning": "She is seated in the centre of the entire solar system.",
  "commentary": "She is the cause/ force behind the self-illumination of the Sun.\n\nThe Sun is the cause of life and of its existence. He is the cause behind good health. Any person who analyses the help received from the Sun in daily life, will automatically entertain feelings of gratitude towards the Sun and will seek to salute Him. From this emerges the tradition of Surya-namaskara (saluting the Sun) early morning upon waking up.\n\nAkin to this external solar system, within the heart of every being there exists a solar system. ‘Asavādityo Brahma’ states that the external visible Sun and the Sun who resides in the heart are one and the same.\n\nIn the Guru Gita it is said –\n\nhamsābhyām parivrtta hārda kamalē…\n\n2 lotuses that face each other exist within the heart. These two lotuses are symbolized by folding the hands as in namaskar. Lotus needs sunlight to bloom. For this reason, in the heart (chidākāsa), the Sun has positioned himself. He is an embodiment of knowledge (Jnāna) and provides the being with the necessary chaitanya (life force) and knowledge (Jnana). She manifests as this Sun. In other words, She exists subtly within our heart.\n\nThe truth is that the Supreme Mother’s energy can be visualized in every part of the body; in fact in every object in the external visible universe. The food that we take, the rivers, the stones are all forms of Parabrahma.\n\nHowever in certain special centers of the body She can be easily invoked and they are- the centre of the eyebrows, the heart or the position of the navel.  Focusing the mind at any one of these 3 locations enables quick spiritual progress."
