  "meaning": "You are the protector of all that which is deeply secretive and confidential. Please accept my japam, O Divine Mother. Please grace and bless me to achieve spiritual accomplishment and stable intellect.",
  "commentary": "a) She is the most secretive knowledge or tattva.\n\nAtma-vidya (the knowledge of self-realization) is the most secretive knowledge. Its secretiveness is to prevent its misuse and to ensure that it does not fall into the hands of the undeserving and foolhardy.\n\nThe Divine Mother grants this knowledge purely to those who truly deserve; who have complete faith and who are intensely seeking to learn it.\n\nAfter completion of the japa, the following prayer is offered to the Lord –\n\nGuhyāti guhya goptree tvam grahānasmat krtam japamSiddhir bhavatu deveshi tvat prasadat मयिस्थिरा। (mayisthirā.)\n\nb) Guhya also implies that She resides in the guha (cave) called the heart."
