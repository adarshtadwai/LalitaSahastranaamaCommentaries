  "commentary": "a) Her face is as beautiful as a fully bloomed lotus and hence She is addressed as Nalini.\n\nb) She is the spiritual energy that runs through the subtle energy channel of Sushumna.\n\n‘Nala’ is the thin thread-like streak that exists within the stem of the lotus plant and which is the cause/root for the sustenance of the lotus plant. Likewise, in human beings, the spiritual energy flows through the subtle Sushumna naadi, which is the main channel for the flow of spiritual energy. As She exists in the form of this spiritual energy, She is Nalini.\n\nc) Sandal paste is known as nalam. She, to whom sandal paste is very dear, is Nalini.\n\nThose who are on the path of truth, those who are completely into satsang and who undertake spiritual pursuits (sadhana) radiate good energy. Their radiance can be compared to the fragrance that emanates from the flower night-queen. Such persons are also comparable to the sandal paste.\n\nWorshipping the Divine Mother as Nalini helps the person to reach such a state.\n\nIt is said that the fame (kirti) of a being reaches earth, long before the being reaches earth. If the society praises the actions of an individual, then he is subsequently rewarded with a good body and good birth in his next life. Where people curse the person and his actions, the next birth will be in accordance to that.  For this reason, it is important to undertake good actions during the lifetime."
