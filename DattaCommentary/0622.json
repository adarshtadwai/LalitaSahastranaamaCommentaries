  "meaning": "Kleem is Her seed letter (beejakshara).",
  "commentary": "Kleem is known as ‘Kāmaraaja beejam’ as it not only fulfils all the desires (kāma) of the individual but also grants the highest of all desires i.e. liberation.\n\nThe term Kāmaraja signifies its connection to Lord Shiva (Kāmeshwara). Kāma is the seed letter of Lord Shiva. As the Divine Mother resides in the form of this seed letter, She is Kleemkāri.\n\n‘Kleem’ exists in the middle portion (madhya koota) of Balatripura Devi’s mantra.\n\nThis name is alternatively pronounced as ‘Kleemkari’. When pronounced thus, Kleemkari should be understood to mean ‘She who causes Kleem within us’. What is Kleem? Kleem is composed of 3 alphabets (aksharas) in it- ‘Ka, La and Ee (or Eem)’. Among them, ‘Ka’ represents Paramatma (Supreme being or soul), ‘La’ represents the earth element. ‘La’ includes all the individual beings on earth and thus stands for the Jeevatma (individual soul).\n\n‘Eem’ is Lakshmi Devi- the wealth of knowledge. This can be understood from the Sree Suktam, wherein Lakshmi Devi is glorified as-  Padmineem ‘eem’ sharanamaham prapadye.\n\nThis clarifies that ‘eem’ is Lakshmi Devi’s (Padmini’s) seed letter.\n\n‘Kleem’ thus signifies the union of the individual being (jeevatma) and the Paramatma (Supreme being) through the medium of Lakshmi Devi. Lakshmi stands for aishwarya (wealth, prosperity). In this case it is the wealth of knowledge that acts as the medium."
