  "meaning": "She destroys feels of dualism (dvaita) among her devotees.",
  "commentary": "With this we now step into Savitri-vidya This is the knowledge pertaining to the Sun God and the namas 669 (Annada) up to nama 700 (सच्चिदानन्द-रूपिणी) ((Saccidānanda-rūpiṇī)) teach this. These names contain the knowledge pertaining to the Sun galaxy (Surya gola). Savitri-vidya also refers to Savitri- as in Satyavā-savitri story (found in aranya parvam of Mahabharata). Savitri was the wife of Prince Satyavan. When Satyavan died shortly after marriage, She with all her austerities managed to get her deceased husband back to life. Thus Savitri Vidya is also Sanjeevani-vidya (life-giving knowledge)."
