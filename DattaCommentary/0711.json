  "commentary": "The name ‘sādhvi’ has already occurred earlier in the Sahasranama (nama 128) and the speciality of this Sahasranama is that it is free from the errors of repetition (purarukti dosha). Therefore, although here it is recited as ‘sādhvi’, it actually consists of two different names- sādhu and ee."
