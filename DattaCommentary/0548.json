  "name_transliterated": "Vimarśa-rūpiṇī",
  "meaning": "She is the power of discrimination between the real and unreal. Such discrimination (vimarsha) leads towards viveka (wisdom).",
  "commentary": "Vimarsha and Prakasha are two aspects of the Absolute Consciousness. Prakasha is the illumination, the Supreme brightness that is beyond the scope of visualization. It requires immense sadhana to be blessed with its vision.\n\nVimarsha on the other hand is critical examination, investigation, discussion, recapitulation, reflecting about the same matter all the time and strengthening our inner beliefs on what is learnt about the Absolute Consciousness.\n\nVimarsha is wrongly understood to mean critical commentary about others. The truth is that it is a deep study about one’s own self. Vimarsha is self- awareness. It is reflective awareness. Even though a mirror reflects the image, to see it we have to open our eyes. In other words, viewing of the reflection is possible only with open eyes. It is of extreme importance especially in the case of viewing our eyes. No being can see his/her eyes except as a reflection in the mirror. Likewise, the individual consciousness has to contemplate on his nature at first.\n\nThe absolute consciousness can be understood only after proper understanding of the self (self- awareness or atma Jnana). This is Vimarsha.\n\nThe Supreme Mother is the energy of Vimarsha within the being and causes such knowledge to arise in the devotees."
