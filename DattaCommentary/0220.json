  "meaning": "She possesses the greatest wealth (aishwarya) of this creation.",
  "commentary": "‘Maha’ means ‘greatest’. Aishwarya refers to wealth (prosperity) and knowledge (vidya) enjoyed. Such materialistic earnings are essential to survive in this universe. The Divine Mother, on the other hand, possesses the greatest affluence and is called Mahāishwarya. Her wealth is the unending seed energy; without which this creation itself would not have come into existence! This energy is referred to as Brahma.\n\nOffering the result of one’s good actions to Her feet will render the deed/action prosperous (mahaishwarya). Mahaishwarya leads to Mahabhoga (supreme bliss)."
