  "number": 155,
  "name_devanagari": "निरीश्वरा",
  "name_transliterated": "Nirīśvarā",
  "meaning": "The Supreme Energy (Supreme Mother) has no father (janita) nor Lord (adhipa, leader).",
  "commentary": "Eśwara means ‘Lord/ ruler’. Nir+ Eśwara means ‘without any ruler’. Through this, we understand that there is no force bigger than her. She is the Lord of all Lords, leaders of all leaders.Declares the Upanishad –\n\nन छास्य कस्ह्छिज्जनिता न छाधिपह् (Na chāsya kashchijjanitā na chādhipah)\n\nThe next few names teach about the six inner enemies (arishadvargas) that exist within the individual. While declaring that the Supreme Mother is devoid of them, they also teach ways to overcome them. While externally these names appear as if they are profusely praising Her, they in reality create in the person a deep desire to get rid of them and to scale greater heights. To inculcate good traits, willful practice is a must. Krishna emphasizes this when He says to Arjuna –\n\n‘Abhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyena ca grhyate’."
