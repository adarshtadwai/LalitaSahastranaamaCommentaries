  "meaning": "She resides in those who perform the abdominal lock (odhyana bandha).",
  "commentary": "This knot prevents the yogic energy from flowing downwards. With this, the energy begins to move upwards towards the intellect and leads to the advancement of the intellect (buddhi vikasa).\n\nThe tradition of tying the waistband (odiyana, molataadu) emerges out of this yogic practice. The waist should eternally be tied. This acts as a support for the nādis (energy channels) that pass through this point. While the waistband is an external belt, this abdominal lock (odyana bandha) is an internal lock. Odhyana also refers to Odisha state. She resides here as Girija Devi."
