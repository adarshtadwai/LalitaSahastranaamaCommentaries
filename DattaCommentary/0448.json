  "name_devanagari": "स्वस्तिमती",
  "name_transliterated": "Swastimatī",
  "meaning": "May Indra, the Lord of heaven do good. May the Sun (Poosha) do good to us. May Trayaksha destroy the enemies and bring about peace. May Bruhaspati, the Guru of the Devatas, bless me with the right intellect. Let there be peace everywhere and on every plane.",
  "commentary": "a)\tShe is the eternal truth (swasti) and hence is Swastimatī.b)\tAs the entire Swasti (well being, goodness) of the creation is under Her control, She has been aptly praised as Swastimati. Her mind (manas) and intellect (buddhi) are loaded with goodness, compassion and well being (swasti).c)\tShe is an epitome of peace (shanti) that cannot get disturbed under any circumstances. This is Swasti.\n\nThe following verse is recited at the closing ceremony of Vedic occasions –\n\nSwasti prajabhya paripala yantamNyayena margena maheem maheesahGo-Brahmanebhyah shubhamastu nityamLokah samastah sukhino bhavantu.\n\nSwasti is composed of two letters- swa (meaning- su, good, well) and asti (being). It means seeking the wellbeing of all the entities within the creation. The shanti mantra says-\n\nSwasti na indro vridhashravāh Swasti nah पोओस्हा (pooshā) vishwavedāhSwasti nastārkshyo arishtanemih Swasti no brihaspatir dadhātu."
