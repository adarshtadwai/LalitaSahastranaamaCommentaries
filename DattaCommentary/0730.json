  "meaning": "She is an embodiment of love.",
  "commentary": "Devotion has been compared to love (prema). Love causes the mind to be focused on the object of love. A mother who loves her child always thinks about him/her; a newlywed wife has her thoughts focused on her husband. Likewise, similar love should be developed towards divinity. Thoughts such be endlessly focused on the Lord. Such love is devotion (bhakti)."
