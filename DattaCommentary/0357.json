  "name_transliterated": "Tāpatrayāgni-santapta-samāhlādana-candrikā",
  "meaning": "Like the full moon She emits cooling rays to douse the fire of afflictions (tāpatrayās) in which people are burning and suffering.",
  "commentary": "(This entire line is one single name. Do not pause between santapta and samāhlādana during recitation. Doing so alters the meaning. It will then imply that She is overloaded with afflictions.)\n\nTāpa means heat and traya means three. Afflictions /troubles are of 3 types- ādhyātmika, ādhibhoutikā and ādhi daivika. The intensity of the afflictions causes a lot of suffering (heat).\n\nĀdhyātmika tāpatrayās do not imply any spiritual afflictions. Here it refers to the afflictions of the physical body such as fever, headache, diseases and so on.\n\nĀdhibhoutika tāpatrayās refers to those afflictions that fall on our head due to other external circumstances such as troubles because of insects, animals and other people.\n\nĀdhidaivika refers to afflictions caused due to extremities of nature for example due to floods, draught, extreme or poor rainfall and so on.\n\nMoon rays soothe and cool. Likewise the Supreme Mother soothes those devotees who are in absolute distress and are sinking under the weight of these afflictions and pacifies them."
