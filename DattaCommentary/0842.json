  "commentary": "This life becomes a burden to him who does not possess the supreme Jnana. Such person fears old age and death. He who has the Supreme Knowledge, on the other hand, entertains no fears. To him birth and death are not bondages. He willingly seeks another birth so that he can serve the guru. To attain such a state the life given to us should be utilized wisely. In such persons, the Supreme Mother burns away the bondages and fears that entrap."
