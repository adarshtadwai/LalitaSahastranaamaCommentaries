  "meaning": "She is devoid of upadhi (carrier, body).",
  "commentary": "In the literal sense the physical body is the upadhi (carrier, shareera) for all beings as it carries the being who is seated within. When the resident (inner being) of this carrier drops it and goes away, the body is called Shava (dead body). The all-pervading Supreme Energy does not require any such carrier for existence.\n\nWhen the Supreme Energy descends and takes on a carrier (body) for the upliftment of others, it is called an avatara. Even forms such as that of Durga or Chandi were carriers taken for the benefit of others."
