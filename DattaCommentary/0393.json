  "name_transliterated": "Prabhāvatī",
  "meaning": "She is shining with infinite and endless effulgence (knowledge).",
  "commentary": "Often behind the head of the deity or a saint a halo is projected. This circle of light depicts the endless effulgence and knowledge. Prabha is the self-illuminating light.\n\nShe is the Sun who has surrounded herself with infinite rays. Rays prevent us from seeing the Sun. Yet, these rays are not separate from Her and have not enclosed Her. These rays are an inherent part of Her and cause Her illumination. It would be more apt to say that She is light. She is the force behind the illumination; She causes the illumination and She is the cause for us to see Her illumination.\n\nThere is a very popular Vedic statement – Asavadityo Brahma- the visible Sun is Parabrahma. Within the heart there is a Sun, who is none other than Parabrahma. With this belief, tarpana should be offered to the Sun Lord at the time of Sandhya."
