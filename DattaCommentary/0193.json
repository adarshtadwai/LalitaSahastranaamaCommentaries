  "name_devanagari": "दुष्टदूरा",
  "name_transliterated": "Duṣṭadūrā",
  "meaning": "She drives away the bad feelings and thoughts (dushta bhāvana). She is unattainable by those who entertain bad thoughts and are evil.",
  "commentary": "During recitation, this line should not be split अस्दुष्टदूर (asDuṣṭadūra) durāchāra (pause) śamanī dośa varjita. ‘दुष्टदूरऽ (‘Duṣṭadūra’) is one name while ‘Durachāra śamani’ is one name. Pausing after durachāra alters the meaning causing negative effect.\n\nThe aim behind spiritual practices is purely to bring out a transformation in the individual, through which the bad traits within are driven away. Every individual should, at periodic intervals, reflect the degree of change that has come over in him/her due to the Sadhana. ‘In what way have I become a better person today?’ should be a question posed to the self every night before retiring.\n\nThe Divine Mother in this way drives away the evil thoughts and intents within the devotee.\n\nThose with evil thoughts, deeds and intents cannot even fathom and comprehend Her. Desire to worship Her or to understand Her will not even spurt in such a mind."
