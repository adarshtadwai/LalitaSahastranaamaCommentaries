  "name_transliterated": "Māyā",
  "meaning": "She is the individual illusion and ignorance.",
  "commentary": "The composite/ cosmic illusion that envelops the entire creation is Mahā māyā. Māyā is the ignorance and illusion at the individual (microcosm) level. The illusion of one individual differs from that of another. Wealth and power obtained due to knowledge, fame or any other means causes intoxication in the individual that intensifies his ego. This is māyā. Wealth in itself is harmless; its combination with māyā is dreadful.\n\nTo cross over this illusion (māyā), it is necessary to hold on to Her feet. She is the illusion and only She can aid the person to cross over this illusion."
