  "meaning": "She is the swan (hamsa) who swims in the mind (manas) of genuine devotees (bhaktas).",
  "commentary": "She swims in the mind which is kept very pure and sacred. Such a mind is the sacred Mānasa sarovara (manasa is the mind; sarovara is the lake).\n\nSwans are very hard to spot. Even at Mānasa Sarovara near Kailasa, it is rare to spot swans. These sacred birds do not like even the scent of human beings and hence they approach the lake selectively when it is devoid of human presence. They are very delicate birds that survive purely on water for sustenance."
