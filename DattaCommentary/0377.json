  "commentary": "She grants victory or is the cause of victory.\n\nJaya symbolizes the number 18. Mahabharata is also called Jaya. 1+8=9. The soul (atma) has 8 qualities. Those who develop and nurture these 8 qualities are blessed with the vision of the Supreme who is non-dual (represented by the number 1). The combination of 8 qualities and 1 Supreme essence is 9, which represent total completeness (poornatva). This is the true victory that She grants.\n\nFrom now on yogic lessons known as bandhās, for those who have been initiated into those streams of yoga, are taught. Bandhana means to bind/ tie a knot. The vital air (Prāna vāyu) is tied down and held firmly at certain points and rendered immobile. Hata yoga is a series of bandhana kriyas. The term ‘hata’ means ‘extreme willpower’. Using extreme willpower these knots are bound firmly. These are special techniques that need to be learnt and mastered purely under the guidance of an able Guru. For the ordinary people, kriya yoga is the most ideal. Such bandhas when undertaken without the guidance of an efficient Guru is very harmful. Initially they may appear to work but there are innumerable cases where they have misfired. When undertaken with the proper guidance of an able Guru, even the most difficult bandhas can be accomplished with great ease and perfection."
