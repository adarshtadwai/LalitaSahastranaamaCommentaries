  "name_transliterated": "Satyasandhā",
  "meaning": "Her resolves all are woven around truth (satya); She is bound by truth.",
  "commentary": "‘Sandhā’ means ‘to unite the mind’. It is only truth that can unite the mind and bless us with Her vision. Sandhā also means to completely focus and fix the mind at one point. Just as with acute precision and concentration, the arrow is shot to hit the goal, the guru mantra is to be used as the arrow that is to be shot to dig out the untold truths about Paramatma. Towards this, complete concentration and adherence to the truth are the links."
