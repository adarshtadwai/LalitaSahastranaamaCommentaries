  "commentary": "In deep sleep state of Shushupti there is no self-identification. It can also be compared to a state of total ignorance where the person is not even aware of his existence, his name etc. When the individual wakes up from this deep sleep, realization of body, self, name etc. dawns upon him. The mind, intellect and the senses begin to function. This is the start of creation. This state of expansion is the state of Brahma."
