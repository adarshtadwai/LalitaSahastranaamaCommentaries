  "commentary": "1) She is the intoxication caused by spiritual knowledge in the person.\n\nWhen the devotee is totally immersed in the supreme knowledge, he is said to be in a state of intoxication (bliss) wherein he loses cognizance of his body. At such time, pleased with the devotee, She performs the tandava (cosmic) dance within his mind.\n\n2) She is eternally balanced.\n\nThis name can be split as Vārunimat+ avhihala. Vārunima is Adishesha (the 1000 headed serpent who carries the load of the entire universe). Despite bearing this weight of the universe, Adishesha remains stable and balanced. Here She is compared with Adishesha, to drive home the fact that like Him, She is calm and balanced in all situations.\n\n३) स्हे इस् थे वारुणि विद्य। (3) She is the Vāruṇi vidya.)\n\nVāruni vidya (form of knowledge known as Vāruni) is an extremely sacred branch among the Upanishads. It is a very holy and blessed knowledge that contains the teachings about Varuna given by Bhrugu Maharsihi."
