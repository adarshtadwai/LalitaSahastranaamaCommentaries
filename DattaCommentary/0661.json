  "meaning": "Both sat (truth) and asat (falsehood, non-existence) are Her forms.",
  "commentary": "‘Sat’ is the supreme truth. It is one of the aspects of Paramatma (sat+chit+ ananda). ‘Asat’ is the destructible world visible to us which in reality is not true (non-existing). ‘Sat’ is that which is visible during meditation. ‘Asat’ is the world that is visible otherwise. ‘Sat’ is the chit shakti (power of conciousness). ‘Asat’ refers to the indriyas (senses) or avidya (ignorance)."
