  "name_transliterated": "Svargāpavargadā",
  "meaning": "Where there are comforts there can be no liberation; where the mind entertains thoughts of liberation there can be no comforts. Yet, to a person who devotedly worships the ever-beautiful Goddess, both bhoga (comforts) and liberation (Moksha) can occur in parallel.",
  "commentary": "The mind that seeks comforts at all times seeks the same even after death. To such beings, the Divine Mother grants the comforts of heaven (swarga). Heavenly comforts are perishable and temporary. Apavarga refers to permanent liberation.\n\nThere is a famous quote which states-\n\nYatrāsti bhogo na ca tatra mokshah yatrāsti moksho na ca tatra bhogahSrisundari sevana tatparānām boghasca mokshasca karāsthayeva"
