  "meaning": "She assumes authority over money (dhana).",
  "commentary": "Here it is to be understood that She has incarnated as Kubera. Kubera is the Lord of wealth and of the northern direction. She is granting the dhana (wealth) that is earned through adherence to dharma (righteous attitude).\n\nEach direction fulfils one desire. For example, facing east and performing vrata or puja is to secure fulfillment in earning of wealth (artha) and fulfillment of desires (kaama). To acquire knowledge, prayers are offered in the western direction; to get relief from diseases prayers are offered in the southern direction. Facing east and praying also secures the grace of the deity upon us. To earn liberation, prayers are offered in the northern direction. There are some people who eat facing different directions. Only the Nairriti (south west) direction is eliminated, as this is the direction of demons.\n\nThe location of Kubera, the Lord of wealth would be a puzzle to many. North is the position for securing liberation and Kubera is seated here. On his left is vayu (Wind-God) and on his east (Ishanya) is Lord Shiva. This is to imply that only through Pranayama one can reach Kubera (true wealth). Kubera is a close associate of Shiva. Through Kubera one can reach Shiva. It is very difficult to directly reach Ishanya."
