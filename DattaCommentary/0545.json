  "meaning": "Pulomaja (Sachi Devi), wife of Lord Indra ardently worships Her.",
  "commentary": "Indra was filled with great remorse after killing the terrible demon Vrittasura. The task was undeniably undertaken for the welfare of the world, but still the regret of having killed a great ascetic (tapasvi) haunted him. Added to this was the fact that the demon had to be destroyed through slightly crooked means and this did not digest well. Along with Vrittasura hordes of demons were also destroyed. In order to alleviate himself from this sin (prayaschitta) Indra hid himself in the lotus stalk in a pond and worshipped the Lord. After a certain period he transformed into a snake and continued to live in the same pond, all the time contemplating on the Supreme.\n\nSnakes are reptiles that suffer from excessive fear. The hiss of a snake is a display of this inner fear. A small sound causes it to disappear into its hole out of fear. True fear can be understood purely through practical experience. For this reason Lord Indra transformed into a snake. Meanwhile Sachi Devi, his wife, had to suffer at the hands of Nahusha, who temporarily had assumed the position of Indra during the latter’s absence. Pulomaja (Sachi Devi) who was in complete distress approached Lord Vishnu who further directed her to worship the Supreme Mother in the form of Katyayini. The Supreme Mother came to her rescue. Nahusha’s ego and arrogance led to his downfall and he fell to earth as a snake. Sachi Devi’s worship was thus rendered fruitful and Indra was restored to his original position."
