  "meaning": "She bestows absolute liberation (kaivalya), which is the ultimate goal of yoga.",
  "commentary": "Kaivalya means absolute unity, detachment, and isolation. Kevala sthithi (the non- dual state, the state of being alone) is itself kaivalya. In deep samadhi, there is no companion, no other thought and no other desire. It is a non-dual (kaivalya) state and can be achieved purely through Her grace."
