  "name_transliterated": "Kāmyā",
  "meaning": "Attaining Her is the highest desire entertained by her devotees.",
  "commentary": "Of all the desires, the most-supreme desire is the desire for liberation. All other desires apart from this are worthless. Attaining Her means attaining liberation.\n\nKāmyā also means daylight. Vedas extol the Supreme Mother as Kāmyā i.e. daylight. Daylight dispels darkness (ignorance). This is a gentle reminder to devotees to desire liberation which dispels darkness and ignorance in entirety."
