  "meaning": "He who showers false praises in our presence but who spoils our tasks behind our back should not be befriended. Persons who resort to unethical and magical practices should never be befriended. He who guides and advices against bad deeds, he who shows the good path, he who can keep the secrets, he who only propagates the truth and who brings out the good traits in us, He who rushes to the aid when in distress is a true friend.",
  "commentary": "There is no orphan in this world; likewise there is no being who is friendless. People in distress connect more to the Lord and hence they find that he is their true friend.\n\nWho is a friend? The one who showers false praises in our presence but criticizes behind the back should not be befriended under any circumstances. The following sookti acts as a guideline for selecting of friends.\n\nPratyakshe priya vaadinam paroksham kaarya hantaaramVarjayet taadrusham mitram maaya mayavarim yathaPaapaan nivaarayati yojayate hitaayaaGuhancha guhati gunaan prakati karotiAapadgatam na jahaati dadaati kaleSanmitra rakshana midam prapadanti dheeraa.\n\nSadguru is our true friend. Traits of a true friend can be found in Supreme Mother and in the Sadguru."
