  "name_devanagari": "सहस्रदलपद्मस्था",
  "name_transliterated": "Sahasradala-padmasthā",
  "meaning": "She is seated within the thousand-petalled lotus (Sahasrara).",
  "commentary": "The term ‘thousand’ is used to define infinity. This louts at the Sahasrara has infinite petals. Infinity corresponds to a state that is over and above the 6 Chakras and is over and above all forms of limitations. This depicts a fully bloomed state.\n\nThis Chakra corresponds to the seventh month of pregnancy. The limbs are totally formed in the foetus and it begins to kick. The foetus is blessed with life (sampoorna jeeva) at this stage. The capacity to think (ālochana shakti) develops in the foetus.Up to this stage the Supreme Mother stays with the foetus, protects and supplies all the materials needed for its nourishment and growth. The most critical body parts would have been developed. Hereafter the baby develops the capacity to grow independently. Up to now the responsibility that belonged to the Supreme Mother now gets transferred to the physical mother who has to raise the child. As per our tradition this is the month when the expecting mother returns to her mother’s house for delivery.\n\nTo bless the mother with the successful completion of this responsibility the Supreme Mother has blessed all women with soft/gentle nature (mrdu swabhaava). With its aid mothers are able to sustain the pressures of motherhood and sail through it successfully."
