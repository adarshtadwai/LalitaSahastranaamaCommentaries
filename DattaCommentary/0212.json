  "commentary": "The emphasis here is on Her universal form (virat roopa). She is in the form of this vast universe. She is all pervading.\n\n2) She is the cause behind the illusion (moha) that exists in every mind and hence is Mahā-rūpā.The Vedic statement ‘Ropayati mohayatīti rūpam’ means – It is form (rūpā) that causes moha (illusion).\n\nMoha can be understood to mean illusion, deep emotional attachment, infatuation.\n\nIsn’t it a fact that this visible universe is the cause for our illusion? How could illusion exist in the absence of this universe? We also know that this entire universe is Her form. Therefore we can decipher that through Her form She causes illusion in the individual mind.\n\nHowever, in those who are able to see this entire universe as Her form and are able to see Her in everything and every being, She does not cause illusion. Instead, from such people She dispels illusion."
