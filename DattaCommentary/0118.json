  "commentary": "(This is also read as bhakta priya).\n\nBhakti means devotion and intense love towards divinity. It also incorporates an active involvement by the devotee in the worship of this divinity.\n\nBhakti comes from the root word ‘bhaj’, which means ‘to share’ and ‘to belong to’. Bhakti also means giving up differences of every kind and uniting collectively in the path of devotion. In other words it emphasizes that there should be no vibhakti (differences/ split of any kind or form) amongst the people."
